Dominic Toretto ...

3
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.817
You're sentenced to 25 years in prison

4
00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:29.359
Without possibility of parole

7
00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:46.172
We are on the spot

8
00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:48.571
Where there was an escape

9
00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:50.987
26 inmates

10
00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:53.204
All detainees were found

11
00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.360
With the exception of one Dominic Toretto

12
00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:03.915
It is believed that this escape was possible

13
00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.306
With federal agent Brian O'Conner

14
00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:07.362
Police looking for runaway tonight

15
00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.463
Several federal agents and local police

16
00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:10.489
Met to find them on

17
00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.550
Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto

18
00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:18.252
Despite the fact that all are in their search

19
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.126
Nobody knows where they are.

20
00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.154
Let's get out of here

21
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:07.869
Easy, my friends

22
00:04:08.603 --> 00:04:09.745
I'm

23
00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:13.794
Mia ...

24
00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:24.363
Let

25
00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:28.178
Dominic arrived?

26
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.038
No. When was the last time you heard them?

27
00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:33.820
A few weeks ago, somewhere in Ecuador

28
00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:38.741
How are you? What do you mean?

29
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.420
You know the other side of the law

30
00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:46.919
Do not stay long. Yes.

31
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:01.921
What beautiful child. Can I get it?

32
00:05:29.732 --> 00:05:31.046
Excuse me please

33
00:05:35.164 --> 00:05:36.695
What's in Rio, Vince?

34
00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:41.414
After you've ruined everything in LA?

35
00:05:45.893 --> 00:05:48.092
S over to South America

36
00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.109
Do not continue if it was not Rosa

37
00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:14.695
Knows?

38
00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:27.996
So here ...

39
00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:30.103
There emerged something

40
00:06:31.137 --> 00:06:33.511
We hope to be here already but Dominic

41
00:06:33.932 --> 00:06:36.430
We need to do this without him

42
00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:39.155
It's a good game

43
00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:41.282
Some cars, easy targets

44
00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:45.888
Gather a team to make them

45
00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:48.541
I need some people

46
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.408
I do not know.

47
00:06:50.574 --> 00:06:54.735
Here, cars can easily download and get good money

48
00:06:56.188 --> 00:06:57.670
They are easy money

49
00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:59.735
From what I realize

50
00:07:01.605 --> 00:07:03.936
Both need money

51
00:07:44.534 --> 00:07:45.989
What are you reading?

52
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:48.722
A travel guide. Yes?

53
00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:55.879
What's New?

54
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.488
I know all these places

55
00:08:03.753 --> 00:08:05.330
Yes?

56
00:08:06.053 --> 00:08:07.752
All isolates

57
00:08:22.215 --> 00:08:23.772
Here we go

58
00:08:36.988 --> 00:08:38.538
Excuse me. Everything is ok?

59
00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:39.769
Yes

60
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.397
Sorry buddy. Go, please.

61
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.838
I've found.

62
00:09:23.099 --> 00:09:24.617
Yes, the second car.

63
00:09:35.387 --> 00:09:36.614
What is it?

64
00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.513
Labels police. These machines have been followed.

65
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.471
Look who's here.

66
00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:27.064
How nice that you're okay.

67
00:10:30.273 --> 00:10:32.428
I thought I told you to leave easily. I had no "fuel".

68
00:10:33.226 --> 00:10:34.781
I had to make a call.

69
00:10:35.364 --> 00:10:37.389
No more talk. We have to hurry.

70
00:10:37.863 --> 00:10:39.691
Come on, Vince.

71
00:10:41.923 --> 00:10:43.675
I take the GT40.

72
00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:22.365
Ladies first.

73
00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:30.388
Hey. Wait.

74
00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:34.138
Hey, this is my car safe.

75
00:11:41.438 --> 00:11:43.010
See you soon, baby

76
00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:52.463
That's fine, we'll be fine. We deliver cars.

77
00:11:58.765 --> 00:12:01.357
Be careful what you do. Wait my phone.

78
00:12:05.303 --> 00:12:06.732
Go ahead.

79
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.457
Where to go?

80
00:12:26.052 --> 00:12:27.429
Where to go?

81
00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.288
We are robbed. Tell them to stop the train.

82
00:12:39.505 --> 00:12:41.163
Go after the girl.

83
00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:44.071
Hurry.

84
00:13:12.923 --> 00:13:14.886
Take the other car.

85
00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.762
Dominic is a bridge.

86
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:12.867
The first car is okay.

87
00:15:13.598 --> 00:15:15.151
View in another.

88
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:20.377
Wait!

89
00:16:52.456 --> 00:16:53.907
I had to make a call?

90
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.173
Phone sucks, O'Conner.

91
00:16:57.252 --> 00:16:58.833
Phone sucks.

92
00:17:19.432 --> 00:17:22.201
I have created some problems today.

93
00:17:23.129 --> 00:17:24.539
Three people have died.

94
00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:27.366
And three DEA agents.

95
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:29.932
Of course, so are businesses.

96
00:17:30.401 --> 00:17:32.625
Sometimes things go wrong you have proposed.

97
00:17:33.936 --> 00:17:36.127
Everything interests me is the car.

98
00:17:36.391 --> 00:17:38.843
And tell me where he will let go.

99
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.173
You talk nonsense.

100
00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:47.203
I do not know how you do business

101
00:17:49.012 --> 00:17:52.711
But here in Rio ... We do otherwise.

102
00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:57.308
Strangely, just the same.

103
00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:01.604
You know ...

104
00:18:04.137 --> 00:18:06.063
I regret that your sister is so beautiful

105
00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:12.966
Wherever they are, one will find

106
00:18:57.778 --> 00:19:00.664
American escapees killed three DEA agents in a robbery

107
00:19:04.065 --> 00:19:06.847
Police say they are extremely dangerous

108
00:19:07.098 --> 00:19:10.721
If anyone sees immediately notify authorities

109
00:19:21.174 --> 00:19:22.908
Mia?

110
00:19:23.578 --> 00:19:25.130
Hey ..

111
00:19:27.412 --> 00:19:30.156
Are you okay? Yes, you?

112
00:19:40.331 --> 00:19:44.003
A gun? Just like Toretto

113
00:19:46.532 --> 00:19:47.860
Where's Vince?

114
00:19:51.408 --> 00:19:52.495
He'll be here.

115
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:56.451
You are everywhere stiri.V agents were blamed for killing the train.

116
00:19:57.418 --> 00:19:59.884
Why are we looking for those?

117
00:20:00.443 --> 00:20:02.587
Feds will try to catch us.

118
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.874
They send the best. We gotta get out of here.

119
00:20:06.278 --> 00:20:08.481
We know one thing ...

120
00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:13.087
As will this car.

121
00:20:14.244 --> 00:20:17.774
There's something in it. We know what it is, and what are plotting.

122
00:20:39.992 --> 00:20:42.744
Listen. They are professionals, like speed and will do anything to escape.

123
00:20:42.744 --> 00:20:45.988
So be careful. I find, arrest and bring them back.

124
00:20:46.638 --> 00:20:50.526
And another thing. Do not let it get in the car.

125
00:20:52.064 --> 00:20:54.413
We will not catch them. Let's go hunting.

126
00:20:57.263 --> 00:20:59.155
Agent Hobbs? Are the local police chief.

127
00:21:00.355 --> 00:21:03.530
Sorry about your people.

128
00:21:07.047 --> 00:21:08.395
Let me tell you something about these people.

129
00:21:08.395 --> 00:21:10.667
One worked undercover police and was 5 years

130
00:21:10.956 --> 00:21:18.076
The other is a professional, was jailed twice, and spent half a lifetime after the border.

131
00:21:19.797 --> 00:21:21.425
If I can help you.

132
00:21:21.826 --> 00:21:22.609
Two things.

133
00:21:22.609 --> 00:21:24.006
1. I need an interpreter.

134
00:21:24.006 --> 00:21:25.526
Of course.

135
00:21:25.526 --> 00:21:27.602
I want it.

136
00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:30.658
You heard me.

137
00:21:30.658 --> 00:21:32.782
But why? We have more experienced people.

138
00:21:32.782 --> 00:21:34.574
I like his smile.

139
00:21:35.173 --> 00:21:36.372
What is the second requirement?

140
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.996
I do not stand in its way.

141
00:21:51.132 --> 00:21:52.669
Brian.

142
00:21:54.387 --> 00:21:55.843
I have something to tell you.

143
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.623
Brian, Dom ...

144
00:21:58.623 --> 00:22:01.091
What folly.

145
00:22:01.658 --> 00:22:03.138
Where you been man?

146
00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:07.282
See how you talk.

147
00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:10.471
We need better answers. Done, both.

148
00:22:14.783 --> 00:22:16.340
Where were you, Vince?

149
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.159
All I ask area.

150
00:22:20.045 --> 00:22:21.939
If you go there, I drove directly to you.

151
00:22:22.324 --> 00:22:23.475
I had to wait.

152
00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:26.070
Nonsense! It was your job!

153
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:31.076
Reach O'Connor! If you say that's not to blame, so e.

154
00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:33.069
Go and ride.

155
00:22:47.608 --> 00:22:48.940
Look, I want to extend my business in your country

156
00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:53.032
But to be honest ...

157
00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:55.453
Your business is too violent.

158
00:22:56.555 --> 00:22:58.090
Let me tell you two stories

159
00:22:58.309 --> 00:22:59.794
Now 500 years

160
00:23:01.157 --> 00:23:02.123
Portuguese and Spaniards came here

161
00:23:04.453 --> 00:23:06.559
Each country wanted to take for them

162
00:23:09.266 --> 00:23:11.672
Spaniards came to show us who's boss

163
00:23:16.326 --> 00:23:17.921
They killed everyone.

164
00:23:22.185 --> 00:23:24.435
I prefer Portuguese

165
00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:27.424
They came bearing gifts.

166
00:23:27.749 --> 00:23:29.919
Mirrors, scissors things that people did not

167
00:23:35.077 --> 00:23:37.134
And they continued to take the Portuguese

168
00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:41.101
And that is why Brazilians speak Portuguese

169
00:23:44.258 --> 00:23:48.735
If you dominate a people with purple, eventually will retaliate

170
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.198
Because they have nothing to lose.

171
00:23:52.604 --> 00:23:54.246
And that's the key

172
00:23:56.322 --> 00:23:58.151
I give them something to lose

173
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.600
Electricity, water, school children

174
00:24:05.581 --> 00:24:07.604
To lead a better life

175
00:24:09.008 --> 00:24:10.759
Mine.

176
00:24:12.714 --> 00:24:13.991
Gentlemen

177
00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:18.764
I apologize for the inconvenience

178
00:24:19.676 --> 00:24:21.467
Reyez Sir, may I speak with you?

179
00:24:22.576 --> 00:24:23.892
I've found.

180
00:24:26.154 --> 00:24:27.371
Excuse me gentlemen.

181
00:24:43.485 --> 00:24:44.977
Almost not see you.

182
00:24:48.841 --> 00:24:49.891
Almost.

183
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:52.986
Wait Dom.

184
00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:55.606
Mia was in that train.

185
00:24:57.344 --> 00:24:59.627
I knew, I would not do any harm.

186
00:25:00.297 --> 00:25:01.610
You ruined the job!

187
00:25:03.872 --> 00:25:05.468
I thought they would cars.

188
00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:08.624
I did not know. They wanted the chip.

189
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.245
Damn.

190
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.906
Need to know.

191
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.325
What happens here?

192
00:25:17.547 --> 00:25:19.268
Nothing. Please, Dom.

193
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:22.128
Let me go to the chip. I make things.

194
00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:26.109
Get out.

195
00:25:30.037 --> 00:25:30.570
What?

196
00:25:31.709 --> 00:25:32.787
Get out.

197
00:25:40.194 --> 00:25:41.720
I have not listened to her again.

198
00:25:42.864 --> 00:25:45.966
Neither when I said it's a cop. Not now.

199
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.299
You never trusted me. And look where we are.

200
00:25:52.215 --> 00:25:55.052
Watch our family! I can go home.

201
00:25:55.628 --> 00:26:01.453
Your sister has no life. Lety was bad?

202
00:26:03.379 --> 00:26:04.926
Where's Lety?

203
00:26:32.851 --> 00:26:35.312
I want to search within a radius of 50 km, which distributes all tanks.

204
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.076
Give me a plastic bag.

205
00:26:44.596 --> 00:26:46.071
Rivez Officer, waiting.

206
00:26:46.931 --> 00:26:48.508
Who asked me? I.

207
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.232
Can I ask why?

208
00:26:52.168 --> 00:26:53.445
I'm not so good.

209
00:26:56.697 --> 00:26:58.430
Your husband worked in the police.

210
00:26:59.789 --> 00:27:02.008
Six months later you get in too. Are you motivated.

211
00:27:03.761 --> 00:27:07.116
And plus, you're the only one that can not be cumparata.Am right?

212
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.792
Yes. Of course.

213
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.747
We have bad news. You know you want the good ones first.

214
00:27:16.194 --> 00:27:18.883
In lagatura what you asked. I found something where they unload the machine.

215
00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.216
A lead from the highway and disappears.

216
00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:24.168
The other result was this.

217
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.117
It's from a GT40?

218
00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:35.858
Give me the news.

219
00:27:36.484 --> 00:27:39.146
I lost the other after.

220
00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:41.867
Not necessarily.

221
00:27:42.749 --> 00:27:44.805
That road leads to town.

222
00:27:45.757 --> 00:27:49.216
A few years ago was erased by water, it's just mud.

223
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.747
If you move you find footprints.

224
00:27:53.685 --> 00:27:54.938
You came prepared.

225
00:27:56.225 --> 00:27:57.835
I'm motivated.

226
00:27:59.588 --> 00:28:01.319
Okay then, look for a car.

227
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.437
What do you think? They are made to order.

228
00:28:37.122 --> 00:28:39.466
Look here. In this example.

229
00:28:47.091 --> 00:28:50.064
Watch this. Same building, same order every week.

230
00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:52.530
It is a sales program.

231
00:29:16.482 --> 00:29:19.123
Books?
They are distributors.

232
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:23.499
The biggest buyers await, not to be forced to call them.

233
00:29:24.548 --> 00:29:27.032
Here are 49 kg. That means 1 million.

234
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.966
It means that each vendor has 10 million dollars?

235
00:29:31.337 --> 00:29:31.805
Yes.

236
00:29:54.796 --> 00:29:56.063
I thought.

237
00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:01.863
What's this? 100 million in cash?

238
00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:05.960
That will remove it from the grid.

239
00:30:08.418 --> 00:30:11.319
I think I can say that's pretty clever. It's a whole network here.

240
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.041
Police!

241
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.989
One way to go in the other corner.

242
00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:40.671
But I?

243
00:30:41.657 --> 00:30:42.580
Stay here.

244
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Go there.

245
00:32:36.515 --> 00:32:38.670
Police! Down!

246
00:32:40.332 --> 00:32:41.974
I caught Toretto.

247
00:32:46.706 --> 00:32:47.817
Hey! Police!

248
00:32:48.876 --> 00:32:50.345
Already know who you are.

249
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.828
Let's go.

250
00:34:08.797 --> 00:34:10.562
Are you okay? Yes.

251
00:34:11.529 --> 00:34:13.614
I'm fine, thanks.

252
00:34:49.283 --> 00:34:52.143
It now seeks three fugitives. We have to separate.

253
00:34:54.378 --> 00:34:57.626
November 2nd, we go south, I will attract. No.

254
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:00.095
Dom is right

255
00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:02.749
I was lucky that I escaped, not knowing what will happen

256
00:35:03.156 --> 00:35:06.188
We have to separate. I am pregnant.

257
00:35:10.765 --> 00:35:12.268
And I already lost family time.

258
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:15.561
I do not want her anymore once

259
00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:18.030
Are you kidding? No.

260
00:35:23.694 --> 00:35:25.822
I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

261
00:35:29.852 --> 00:35:32.805
Dom, promise me you'll stay together.

262
00:35:40.881 --> 00:35:41.935
I promise.

263
00:35:47.741 --> 00:35:49.900
It was crazy, huh?

264
00:36:08.157 --> 00:36:09.738
Something is not connecting.

265
00:36:10.055 --> 00:36:11.256
Toretto and O'Conner ...

266
00:36:12.305 --> 00:36:14.902
It said fuel and then stole him off?

267
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.021
And now they say they have killed three officers?

268
00:36:20.018 --> 00:36:21.895
It makes no sense. Here's what makes sense.

269
00:36:30.614 --> 00:36:31.884
We have their names as they appear to arrest

270
00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:33.806
No extra phone, no less bullet.

271
00:36:34.083 --> 00:36:35.697
We have something?

272
00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:39.214
We have every evidence, fingerprints are all over the car

273
00:36:39.866 --> 00:36:40.773
Anything else?

274
00:36:40.988 --> 00:36:42.384
I watched the car owner

275
00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:46.868
We found that the car is registered to a company by an investor named Hernan Reyez here

276
00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:51.631
Investor?

277
00:36:53.302 --> 00:36:55.521
If something is illegal in Rio, when Reyez is involved.

278
00:36:56.522 --> 00:36:57.429
Well, then are we.

279
00:36:57.949 --> 00:36:59.513
If you find something let me know our fugitives

280
00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:03.434
You sit up in case someone comes back here

281
00:37:03.851 --> 00:37:07.600
I'll watch it on Reyez, I want to know when moving

282
00:37:08.414 --> 00:37:09.900
Roger, boss. Let's go.

283
00:37:12.772 --> 00:37:14.252
To rebuild this car.

284
00:37:16.092 --> 00:37:18.433
It will take something. Well you should start.

285
00:37:19.498 --> 00:37:21.041
They dismantled the car for something.

286
00:37:21.041 --> 00:37:23.183
Do it again and see what is missing

287
00:37:50.542 --> 00:37:51.857
Dom, what you remember about your father?

288
00:37:56.092 --> 00:37:57.417
My father.

289
00:38:05.145 --> 00:38:06.668
It made many a barbecue every Sunday

290
00:38:09.168 --> 00:38:10.528
And invite all the neighborhood

291
00:38:12.855 --> 00:38:14.168
If not go to church, not going anywhere

292
00:38:16.748 --> 00:38:18.830
Every day was in the shop, and every night

293
00:38:20.358 --> 00:38:23.918
It was at the kitchen table with Mia, and helps with homework

294
00:38:26.512 --> 00:38:33.857
And when he went to sleep a few hours in May stood to make plans for the day

295
00:38:37.746 --> 00:38:39.523
I remember everything about my father

296
00:38:40.603 --> 00:38:41.625
All

297
00:38:43.593 --> 00:38:44.777
That's right

298
00:38:45.561 --> 00:38:47.417
I know nothing about my father

299
00:38:50.608 --> 00:38:52.653
I do not remember seeing him laughing, smiling,

300
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.013
Honestly, I do not remember what it looks like

301
00:38:59.963 --> 00:39:02.138
I have no memory at all

302
00:39:07.746 --> 00:39:10.140
Thou shalt not so, Brian

303
00:39:26.979 --> 00:39:28.266
We have no time, Dom

304
00:39:30.123 --> 00:39:31.540
We gotta do something

305
00:39:31.854 --> 00:39:33.439
We must do something now

306
00:39:35.056 --> 00:39:36.188
You're right

307
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.104
Look what we do

308
00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.527
We use this

309
00:39:56.479 --> 00:39:58.170
We will do one last job

310
00:39:58.792 --> 00:40:01.993
And we take all the money in this

311
00:40:03.964 --> 00:40:06.541
And we'll disappear forever

312
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.983
New passports, new life, and we do not look back

313
00:40:15.674 --> 00:40:17.890
We will buy his freedom. Exactly.

314
00:40:18.246 --> 00:40:20.730
You realize that we will fight with the most powerful people in Rio?

315
00:40:21.013 --> 00:40:22.449
Yes.

316
00:40:24.074 --> 00:40:25.700
Then we need a team.

317
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.844
Let's do a quick summary.

318
00:40:35.062 --> 00:40:35.623
What do we have?

319
00:40:35.623 --> 00:40:39.478
We will need a chameleon. Someone who can enter.

320
00:40:40.492 --> 00:40:41.884
Anywhere.

321
00:40:43.296 --> 00:40:43.906
Anything else?

322
00:40:44.387 --> 00:40:47.642
Someone who knows how to talk. It could fool anyone.

323
00:40:48.912 --> 00:40:50.533
I know someone

324
00:40:52.077 --> 00:40:54.920
This man uses many circuits, we need someone who knows the circuit

325
00:40:57.596 --> 00:40:59.447
And through these circuits Reyez will have "walls"

326
00:40:59.948 --> 00:41:02.574
we need someone to go through these "walls"

327
00:41:05.637 --> 00:41:07.496
Anything else? We will need weapons.

328
00:41:08.248 --> 00:41:10.506
someone who is not afraid.

329
00:41:12.057 --> 00:41:16.214
What do we need? The most important.

330
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.925
We need two good drivers.

331
00:41:20.465 --> 00:41:22.265
That would not break under pressure.

332
00:41:23.138 --> 00:41:24.758
What you never lose.

333
00:41:25.674 --> 00:41:26.980
You know it.

334
00:41:55.105 --> 00:41:56.586
Damn.

335
00:41:57.822 --> 00:41:59.931
It seems that they have searched hard.

336
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.824
Just think, if you're here.

337
00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.084
When will you return the car back by Tuesday Luther King?

338
00:42:07.975 --> 00:42:11.042
When you return and you back jacket.

339
00:42:29.195 --> 00:42:30.838
What are you sexy girl.

340
00:42:31.296 --> 00:42:32.712
What time is open?

341
00:42:33.274 --> 00:42:35.760
It opens when I press the trigger.

342
00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:39.402
You want to open?

343
00:42:42.431 --> 00:42:44.340
I told that girl has guts.

344
00:42:45.997 --> 00:42:50.121
Anyone can talk crap in Spanish

345
00:42:52.044 --> 00:42:53.197
What's his problem?

346
00:42:54.948 --> 00:42:56.451
Ugly is ugly and Spanish.

347
00:42:56.905 --> 00:42:57.400
Too bad.

348
00:42:58.119 --> 00:42:59.086
Too bad.

349
00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:01.228
Who are these guys clowns?

350
00:43:01.548 --> 00:43:02.220
There are guys with circuits.

351
00:43:04.353 --> 00:43:06.279
Welcome to Rio, Brazil.

352
00:43:07.227 --> 00:43:08.975
I see you already met.

353
00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:10.426
Here it is.

354
00:43:11.365 --> 00:43:15.571
When you called me in Rio, I thought it was something more exciting.

355
00:43:16.554 --> 00:43:17.272
I miss you.

356
00:43:23.208 --> 00:43:26.135
Terza He is the best man on the east coast circuit.

357
00:43:27.477 --> 00:43:30.104
He is Roman Pierce, we know for a long time.

358
00:43:31.468 --> 00:43:32.844
I did that thing with him in Miami.

359
00:43:33.061 --> 00:43:34.204
I hear you.

360
00:43:38.158 --> 00:43:39.908
What is it?

361
00:43:40.626 --> 00:43:42.094
Yes, we've called you here?

362
00:43:44.283 --> 00:43:45.735
Because we have a job.

363
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.862
Our goal is Hernan Reyez.

364
00:43:50.328 --> 00:43:51.835
He runs around drug dealing.

365
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.907
It has not been caught because no documents

366
00:43:54.394 --> 00:43:57.408
It means that no bank accounts, so it has cash.

367
00:43:58.182 --> 00:43:58.782
Exactly.

368
00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:01.909
It's all over the city.

369
00:44:04.001 --> 00:44:06.984
And we will take it all. All?

370
00:44:07.969 --> 00:44:09.018
All.

371
00:44:09.407 --> 00:44:14.423
It's crazy. We've brought in from another country to rob him?

372
00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:17.496
I thought is business

373
00:44:18.435 --> 00:44:19.985
It appears that you have something personal

374
00:44:20.818 --> 00:44:21.990
That's what it is?

375
00:44:24.833 --> 00:44:26.780
Nothing personal, it's a good deal.

376
00:44:27.906 --> 00:44:29.334
I can not do that.

377
00:44:31.737 --> 00:44:33.843
It's about $ 100 million.

378
00:44:37.265 --> 00:44:37.950
What did you say?

379
00:44:39.763 --> 00:44:42.749
You know .. I changed my mind, until we met

380
00:44:43.971 --> 00:44:44.927
but I thought it was you said ..

381
00:44:45.324 --> 00:44:46.438
Milioade ... 100 dollars.

382
00:44:46.438 --> 00:44:49.313
And we all, we share equally.

383
00:44:50.844 --> 00:44:53.290
And 100 million each, my bag.

384
00:44:54.917 --> 00:44:56.259
My bag.

385
00:44:57.513 --> 00:45:00.618
100 million. Sounds pretty good to me.

386
00:45:02.383 --> 00:45:03.962
You can not take all the points.

387
00:45:05.654 --> 00:45:08.606
Since the attack, will do everything possible to protect others.

388
00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:11.952
Exactly.

389
00:46:07.665 --> 00:46:08.540
Are all.

390
00:46:09.263 --> 00:46:11.043
You are dead men. You're all dead.

391
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.531
You can not hide.

392
00:46:16.279 --> 00:46:17.699
Who is hiding?

393
00:46:18.092 --> 00:46:20.933
Are you crazy? Do you know who owns this house?

394
00:46:21.486 --> 00:46:23.984
Who will steal money?

395
00:46:34.218 --> 00:46:35.448
Do not steal.

396
00:46:45.406 --> 00:46:47.324
Tell your boss who did this

397
00:46:49.167 --> 00:46:50.994
And tell him he will be and more.

398
00:46:55.848 --> 00:46:57.447
Ready.

399
00:46:58.016 --> 00:46:59.390
Start it.

400
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.418
It works very well.

401
00:47:10.698 --> 00:47:12.135
Looking.

402
00:47:14.994 --> 00:47:16.607
Chief, if something was missing, I knew.

403
00:47:44.517 --> 00:47:46.950
It's very well proportioned for a classic car.

404
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:52.482
Must have something.

405
00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.238
They took the chip.

406
00:48:03.024 --> 00:48:04.475
We have something on the scanner.

407
00:48:10.183 --> 00:48:13.170
If you are of our, what was the chip has led to the house.

408
00:48:14.047 --> 00:48:15.215
Are they safe.

409
00:48:15.447 --> 00:48:19.198
How do you know? One is not so bad in the Rio Reyez rob him.

410
00:48:34.498 --> 00:48:35.593
Explain.

411
00:48:36.387 --> 00:48:37.564
They invaded the house.

412
00:48:38.314 --> 00:48:39.198
Who?

413
00:48:39.447 --> 00:48:40.932
The guy in the train.

414
00:48:50.358 --> 00:48:51.580
How did they take?

415
00:48:52.969 --> 00:48:55.121
Have not taken anything. They burned everything.

416
00:48:58.499 --> 00:49:00.048
They set fire to my money?

417
00:49:00.515 --> 00:49:03.216
Yes, and said they will come.

418
00:49:03.719 --> 00:49:04.654
Yes?

419
00:49:33.261 --> 00:49:34.632
Clear all homes.

420
00:49:34.913 --> 00:49:36.789
I want all the money in one place.

421
00:49:40.949 --> 00:49:43.170
In an hour. Got it?

422
00:49:45.872 --> 00:49:47.506
Number 1 is in motion.

423
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.767
Number 2 is in motion.

424
00:50:29.072 --> 00:50:30.322
And me.

425
00:50:50.609 --> 00:50:52.028
I see the number 5.

426
00:51:19.094 --> 00:51:21.141
I know you said money will go somewhere but ...

427
00:51:22.924 --> 00:51:24.592
You will not believe it ...

428
00:51:35.866 --> 00:51:37.448
This thing has become more difficult

429
00:51:39.435 --> 00:51:41.184
If I brought in a police

430
00:51:41.859 --> 00:51:43.434
He has all the "pocket"

431
00:51:44.651 --> 00:51:45.949
It seems that this will be a short trip.

432
00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:46.975
We can do this

433
00:51:46.975 --> 00:51:49.234
We can not. They should not.

434
00:51:50.968 --> 00:51:52.483
This changes nothing.

435
00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:58.374
We follow the plan.

436
00:51:59.234 --> 00:52:03.236
What did you say? From Mission Impossible I got a crazy mission.

437
00:52:06.429 --> 00:52:07.580
Finally man.

438
00:52:08.039 --> 00:52:10.495
You say it's foolish to come in that building.

439
00:52:11.084 --> 00:52:12.394
I can handle it.

440
00:52:16.228 --> 00:52:17.195
What time was robbery?

441
00:52:17.195 --> 00:52:18.548
At 11.

442
00:52:21.242 --> 00:52:22.477
There they are.

443
00:52:24.519 --> 00:52:25.770
Larger.

444
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:29.393
They face covered.

445
00:52:36.964 --> 00:52:38.302
Hey asshole.

446
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.848
Give me your photos with Toretto and O'Conner in Brazil in the last two weeks.

447
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.947
Check out all the planes and everything flying.

448
00:52:57.345 --> 00:52:58.483
Can I change the name but can not change the girls.

449
00:53:00.126 --> 00:53:01.429
Something important.

450
00:53:03.628 --> 00:53:04.908
It's a car in '70

451
00:53:05.281 --> 00:53:05.895
Let's go.

452
00:53:06.177 --> 00:53:07.499
Climb these faxes in the database

453
00:53:07.499 --> 00:53:09.780
and put satellites to check them every 15 minutes.

454
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:13.431
If these cars are moving through the Rio wants to know.

455
00:53:23.925 --> 00:53:24.544
All right?

456
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:25.659
All's Well

457
00:54:39.689 --> 00:54:41.891
The beauty of police offices

458
00:54:44.218 --> 00:54:45.674
Forget them

459
00:54:46.063 --> 00:54:47.534
Here is your money. In camera evidence.

460
00:54:50.942 --> 00:54:54.844
You can be a little careful? You must enter a police station.

461
00:54:56.872 --> 00:54:58.219
Listen to these words anyone?

462
00:55:02.834 --> 00:55:04.485
Some people do not like.

463
00:55:04.736 --> 00:55:06.987
Police stations are not made to keep you inside out

464
00:55:07.695 --> 00:55:10.393
That's the goal. Enter and get out without knowing that I was there.

465
00:55:12.122 --> 00:55:13.451
You need to have someone there.

466
00:55:13.765 --> 00:55:15.596
Even safe to look at that.

467
00:55:21.467 --> 00:55:23.468
Who should do all this?

468
00:55:32.901 --> 00:55:34.096
What do you mean?

469
00:55:35.484 --> 00:55:36.754
Why me?

470
00:55:37.018 --> 00:55:38.392
For most of the mouth

471
00:55:50.439 --> 00:55:51.519
Hello gorgeous.

472
00:55:52.235 --> 00:55:54.000
Dracusorii Look at that sexy

473
00:55:54.772 --> 00:55:56.266
I like your glasses, where you got it?

474
00:55:56.607 --> 00:55:58.125
They frame Guci?

475
00:56:00.575 --> 00:56:01.357
No no ...

476
00:56:03.703 --> 00:56:04.969
Who are you sir?

477
00:56:05.421 --> 00:56:07.152
FBI Agent O'Connor.

478
00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:11.289
Says caucazian.Ce?

479
00:56:12.327 --> 00:56:13.612
Skin.

480
00:56:17.767 --> 00:56:21.044
I'm working on this case and I need to store some evidence

481
00:56:21.855 --> 00:56:23.224
But I have to check the room first.

482
00:56:23.574 --> 00:56:26.294
No. I know you are professional and respect you, I promise

483
00:56:27.842 --> 00:56:29.358
It seems that drag and beasts

484
00:56:34.546 --> 00:56:35.982
I just do my job

485
00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.357
My boss sent me here to check if everything is okay.

486
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.749
It will be okay. Just let me go to draw an eye.

487
00:56:42.283 --> 00:56:43.699
No. Come on man.

488
00:56:44.757 --> 00:56:45.704
Help a brother.

489
00:56:46.295 --> 00:56:47.639
No. And I'm not your brother.

490
00:56:47.639 --> 00:56:48.982
Brother from another mother?

491
00:56:49.669 --> 00:56:51.748
This feature is only for those authorized.

492
00:56:52.014 --> 00:56:53.187
I do not waste time.

493
00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:55.034
I call the embassy. No no.

494
00:56:55.234 --> 00:56:57.723
We are okay. No need to call them. Why?

495
00:56:57.723 --> 00:56:58.907
We are okay.

496
00:56:58.907 --> 00:57:01.001
I took the box. We are okay.

497
00:57:02.068 --> 00:57:03.878
Thanks for your time.

498
00:57:04.904 --> 00:57:07.733
If I was on the other side of glass breaks into your face and your translation.

499
00:57:27.608 --> 00:57:29.720
I think I did better than you as an agent.

500
00:57:32.905 --> 00:57:34.297
Depends what you mean.

501
00:57:38.001 --> 00:57:40.047
Let's see what we have. Enjoy.

502
00:57:55.082 --> 00:57:59.859
I still do not know how to drive. That's why you always accidents.

503
00:58:00.909 --> 00:58:02.597
Do not know how to drive a car remote.

504
00:58:03.655 --> 00:58:05.594
Hush now. Not quiet.

505
00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:14.628
Give me the remote, I think it's left.

506
00:58:17.982 --> 00:58:18.920
Bingo.

507
00:58:20.202 --> 00:58:21.935
What is it? 6 on 6?

508
00:58:22.718 --> 00:58:24.183
8 to 12. July 12

509
00:58:25.195 --> 00:58:26.655
18-inch thick steel

510
00:58:38.168 --> 00:58:39.562
The best security.

511
00:58:39.859 --> 00:58:42.934
How do you know that? Before I know I'm passionate.

512
00:58:43.295 --> 00:58:44.405
To leave it.

513
00:58:45.751 --> 00:58:47.125
But it's a beauty

514
00:58:47.786 --> 00:58:49.421
Beauty in the good way?

515
00:58:50.451 --> 00:58:52.376
It will be very hard to get it.

516
00:58:53.204 --> 00:58:57.594
And as I would like eventually will fail.

517
00:59:53.734 --> 00:59:55.325
Hurry, we have one minute

518
01:00:25.233 --> 01:00:26.045
You know where you're going?

519
01:00:26.045 --> 01:00:27.982
Calm down man.

520
01:00:41.773 --> 01:00:42.960
Police Bureau.

521
01:00:57.022 --> 01:00:58.791
Too much explosive. Again.

522
01:01:01.147 --> 01:01:02.700
Too little.

523
01:01:49.085 --> 01:01:51.112
We signal.

524
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:53.434
We see four rooms.

525
01:01:54.219 --> 01:01:57.826
We have clarity. Rotate 100 degrees.

526
01:01:59.463 --> 01:02:00.767
Isolation of 10 seconds.

527
01:02:03.575 --> 01:02:04.732
We can not get to change rooms?

528
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.826
No, we synchronized with them.

529
01:02:07.531 --> 01:02:08.642
I do not know that we are connected.

530
01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:10.641
We can only watch.

531
01:02:11.921 --> 01:02:13.859
We need this car quick.

532
01:02:14.312 --> 01:02:15.174
Not just fast.

533
01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:16.846
We need something better.

534
01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:21.807
Establish path

535
01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:24.663
O'Connor, we get our cars.

536
01:03:05.608 --> 01:03:06.945
Home, sweet home.

537
01:03:27.216 --> 01:03:28.116
How about that?

538
01:03:31.539 --> 01:03:33.136
I always wanted one.

539
01:03:34.157 --> 01:03:35.686
He holds the record for three years in a row.

540
01:03:39.413 --> 01:03:41.467
You have more guts to bring your partner here Toretto.

541
01:03:42.284 --> 01:03:44.008
Not to mention, it's a cop.

542
01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:46.967
We forget that.

543
01:03:49.061 --> 01:03:50.231
We look for many people.

544
01:03:53.118 --> 01:03:54.555
Thought that will not recognize?

545
01:03:56.322 --> 01:03:57.383
We count on that.

546
01:03:59.978 --> 01:04:05.259
Maybe it holds the record but that monster was not competed before.

547
01:04:07.306 --> 01:04:08.468
It's about to be.

548
01:04:09.747 --> 01:04:11.121
Go Toretto's car in the garage.

549
01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.341
Just give the trophy.

550
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:19.228
Let's go.

551
01:04:22.805 --> 01:04:23.883
Machine to machine.

552
01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:25.781
Car for car?

553
01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.072
If you want, come and take it.

554
01:04:41.121 --> 01:04:42.430
Really?

555
01:04:44.354 --> 01:04:45.539
Where did you get?

556
01:04:48.194 --> 01:04:49.695
Let's show what can O'Conner.

557
01:05:13.416 --> 01:05:15.040
How was it? Camera caught you.

558
01:05:15.718 --> 01:05:17.321
What? You caught.

559
01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.661
We need a faster car.

560
01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.477
Come

561
01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.291
Just drive. Terrible.

562
01:06:00.058 --> 01:06:01.446
I think I fell in love.

563
01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.601
It was good but the room he got three.

564
01:06:10.444 --> 01:06:11.743
Let 's do it again.

565
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.163
That's what you ordered? Yes

566
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.915
Where did you get that?

567
01:06:28.758 --> 01:06:30.446
I had another life before we know.

568
01:06:32.759 --> 01:06:34.481
Okay, but I can do the electrical

569
01:06:34.883 --> 01:06:36.086
we have a problem.

570
01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:39.193
Fingerprint Scanner

571
01:06:40.321 --> 01:06:43.089
If we do not mark any Houdini's Reyez he can not open

572
01:06:43.818 --> 01:06:44.933
How do you know that is footprint?

573
01:06:46.465 --> 01:06:47.616
If you have 100 million in a safe

574
01:06:47.821 --> 01:06:49.256
you grab someone else?

575
01:06:57.616 --> 01:06:58.757
How do we get the impression it?

576
01:07:02.009 --> 01:07:03.032
Han, it's your turn.

577
01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.733
Sure, I dropped the easy part.

578
01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:10.588
Let's go, I lead.

579
01:07:29.068 --> 01:07:29.981
It has six bodyguards.

580
01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:32.715
Seven, do you think is just that?

581
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:41.513
For how long have you been in the army?

582
01:07:51.131 --> 01:07:55.382
I left the army, probably when you quit smoking you.

583
01:07:57.877 --> 01:07:59.255
Eat more chips

584
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.103
And always keep your mouth and hands busy.

585
01:08:03.554 --> 01:08:05.009
Smoking at least two packs a day.

586
01:08:07.886 --> 01:08:09.234
No filter.

587
01:08:13.605 --> 01:08:14.681
You got me.

588
01:08:15.986 --> 01:08:17.851
We can not take fingerprints here.

589
01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:21.778
We have to go elsewhere.

590
01:08:22.047 --> 01:08:23.009
Or ...

591
01:08:24.353 --> 01:08:26.392
Do not send a man to do the job of a woman.

592
01:09:24.386 --> 01:09:25.571
We will succeed, I promise

593
01:09:30.129 --> 01:09:31.214
What is that?

594
01:09:32.873 --> 01:09:34.465
EDRC you're the type who wears thong

595
01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.121
We fingerprints.

596
01:09:37.464 --> 01:09:38.277
Where?

597
01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.184
It's crazy.

598
01:09:45.213 --> 01:09:46.510
Did he slap my ass?

599
01:09:46.822 --> 01:09:48.449
Or you raised loud.

600
01:09:52.136 --> 01:09:53.341
We go.

601
01:09:55.371 --> 01:09:56.702
I'm impressed. Can you take it?

602
01:09:56.986 --> 01:09:59.024
A iua. But I still have not answered my question

603
01:10:06.713 --> 01:10:07.898
We have a problem.

604
01:10:08.607 --> 01:10:10.087
I was discovered. Now we're all looking for.

605
01:10:16.187 --> 01:10:17.128
Wait a minute.

606
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:19.706
Americans have issued mandates.

607
01:10:20.722 --> 01:10:22.034
Agent Al Hobbs

608
01:10:22.847 --> 01:10:23.835
Wait

609
01:10:24.734 --> 01:10:25.579
Hey Dom,

610
01:10:27.688 --> 01:10:28.867
He's the guy you saw?

611
01:10:31.926 --> 01:10:32.774
Yes.

612
01:10:33.567 --> 01:10:35.805
Hobbs is the leader DSS

613
01:10:37.002 --> 01:10:38.079
So good?

614
01:10:38.677 --> 01:10:40.443
When the FBI wants to find someone, she calls him.

615
01:10:41.347 --> 01:10:42.550
It never misses

616
01:10:44.174 --> 01:10:45.469
Type, is the best.

617
01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.690
Blood, bullets, that's his style.

618
01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:51.833
And now we're chasing us.

619
01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:53.815
Dom, you need to move forward.

620
01:10:54.207 --> 01:10:55.282
Yes, but how?

621
01:10:55.537 --> 01:10:57.799
It was hard to watch without us.

622
01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:00.941
We need more space.

623
01:11:03.394 --> 01:11:04.626
He's right.

624
01:11:08.037 --> 01:11:09.815
We need some fresh air.

625
01:11:14.261 --> 01:11:15.184
It has been a hit.

626
01:11:16.222 --> 01:11:17.168
Let's go.

627
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:26.400
Let's go.

628
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:34.134
Lock forward.

629
01:11:34.706 --> 01:11:36.059
Stop. A take away.

630
01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:00.917
Toretto.

631
01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.324
You're arrested.

632
01:12:11.205 --> 01:12:12.368
Arrested?

633
01:12:13.202 --> 01:12:14.591
I feel they are arrested.

634
01:12:15.528 --> 01:12:16.654
But you, Brian?

635
01:12:17.005 --> 01:12:18.311
... Not at all.

636
01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.003
Not at all. Wait a minute.

637
01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:23.810
You will feel.

638
01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:28.241
I am not killed those agents.

639
01:12:29.151 --> 01:12:30.650
It was Reyez. I do not care.

640
01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:32.716
I was sent to bring the two cattle.

641
01:12:35.439 --> 01:12:36.713
Yes, seems to be you

642
01:12:39.735 --> 01:12:40.905
Strange

643
01:12:42.463 --> 01:12:44.120
Tell someone who has betrayed service

644
01:12:49.936 --> 01:12:51.138
You're tough.

645
01:12:52.421 --> 01:12:53.371
Go back and put his hands behind his back.

646
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:59.270
I think not. Boy you have no choice.

647
01:13:06.403 --> 01:13:08.464
Wrong, thinking you're in America.

648
01:13:12.134 --> 01:13:13.432
You're away from home.

649
01:13:18.343 --> 01:13:20.169
Here you are in Brazil.

650
01:13:35.232 --> 01:13:36.982
Come boss, another day.

651
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.688
Come on, it's too hot.

652
01:13:46.767 --> 01:13:48.213
See you soon, Toretto.

653
01:13:50.933 --> 01:13:52.795
Can not wait.

654
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.180
Yes.

655
01:14:31.478 --> 01:14:32.673
I asked.

656
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.391
I've seen.

657
01:15:41.464 --> 01:15:42.797
I do not understand. Why are you here?

658
01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:45.946
Why would you risk for a $ 20 silver?

659
01:15:52.313 --> 01:15:53.270
Worth.

660
01:15:55.561 --> 01:15:56.576
It must run

661
01:15:57.512 --> 01:15:58.575
Hobbs will find

662
01:16:02.263 --> 01:16:04.010
If you have reasons to live, why wait?

663
01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:13.997
Why do you sit?

664
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.142
My husband was a good cop, and honest

665
01:16:24.338 --> 01:16:26.259
Three years ago, was killed in the street

666
01:16:27.728 --> 01:16:28.925
Our next door

667
01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:33.155
Reyez is misleading

668
01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:35.528
Give people things

669
01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:38.574
But everything has a price

670
01:16:42.528 --> 01:16:44.263
People need a new beginning

671
01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:46.323
must be free

672
01:16:56.071 --> 01:16:57.390
Not you and you killed those people on the train

673
01:17:03.992 --> 01:17:06.545
Why do you believe what I tell you?

674
01:17:13.883 --> 01:17:14.699
Hey

675
01:17:18.376 --> 01:17:20.463
Why is it so precious to you?

676
01:17:25.095 --> 01:17:27.992
I did not think anyone can understand

677
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.028
But you can

678
01:18:07.713 --> 01:18:08.918
Almost, but not enough

679
01:18:09.994 --> 01:18:11.353
Dom, it's impossible

680
01:18:11.741 --> 01:18:13.979
We can only deceive rooms invisible cars

681
01:18:17.716 --> 01:18:18.857
And I know where to take them

682
01:18:22.947 --> 01:18:24.014
Let's go

683
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:33.792
Take care not to hurt yourself.

684
01:18:52.904 --> 01:18:54.510
It's been a while since I've never driven anything like

685
01:18:55.243 --> 01:18:56.856
The first time you sit in front

686
01:19:05.446 --> 01:19:06.717
What took so long?

687
01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:09.123
I thought living with thorns or something

688
01:19:11.604 --> 01:19:12.764
Funny.

689
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.910
The 100,000 that you are the next quarter mile

690
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:19.459
Yes, but you have 100 000

691
01:19:19.852 --> 01:19:21.435
After this I will do the job

692
01:19:23.276 --> 01:19:24.602
The next two lines

693
01:19:24.602 --> 01:19:25.967
100 000

694
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:28.343
If we fail the job, we're dead anyway.

695
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:30.697
Be the one million

696
01:19:32.372 --> 01:19:33.229
I like

697
01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:35.870
$ 1 million, the next quarter mile

698
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:37.197
Okay then

699
01:19:38.356 --> 01:19:39.812
I have only one life, they do

700
01:19:41.278 --> 01:19:42.453
What about Dom?

701
01:19:43.294 --> 01:19:44.809
Talk? Or do we beat?

702
01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:47.058
Do not cheat this time.

703
01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:48.963
I quit that.

704
01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:10.740
YES

705
01:21:26.986 --> 01:21:28.128
Good race, O'Conner. Thanks, Dom

706
01:21:36.079 --> 01:21:36.629
Did I mention that I'll never see

707
01:21:36.847 --> 01:21:38.905
That man, was put in front

708
01:21:40.378 --> 01:21:41.484
Did nothing

709
01:21:41.782 --> 01:21:42.955
You left to win

710
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.235
Nonsense

711
01:22:07.751 --> 01:22:08.764
What are you doing?

712
01:22:09.156 --> 01:22:10.297
Shut up, get in the car

713
01:22:17.938 --> 01:22:19.031
It's here.

714
01:22:21.982 --> 01:22:23.231
Find it.

715
01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.798
Hai! Hai! Hai!

716
01:22:40.012 --> 01:22:41.574
Wait.

717
01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:43.326
I waited at the market

718
01:22:45.392 --> 01:22:46.693
Vince, saved my life

719
01:22:52.166 --> 01:22:53.190
Are you hungry?

720
01:22:56.641 --> 01:22:57.766
Yeah sure

721
01:22:58.459 --> 01:22:59.297
Well

722
01:23:01.033 --> 01:23:02.501
You say the prayer.

723
01:23:05.421 --> 01:23:06.669
Thanks Vince.

724
01:23:14.595 --> 01:23:15.860
A burn.

725
01:23:19.017 --> 01:23:20.532
You're the worst cook in the world

726
01:23:28.406 --> 01:23:29.280
Cheers.

727
01:23:30.959 --> 01:23:32.229
We are in Brazil, lead a good life

728
01:23:32.832 --> 01:23:33.126
Yes

729
01:23:35.019 --> 01:23:36.573
You have a little more than 10 million

730
01:23:37.501 --> 01:23:38.578
What do you do with them?

731
01:23:39.829 --> 01:23:40.440
Me?

732
01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:41.692
Yes.

733
01:23:41.692 --> 01:23:42.878
I was thinking about opening a garage

734
01:23:44.356 --> 01:23:46.454
A place where people bring their cars without being skinned

735
01:23:48.096 --> 01:23:48.750
Really?

736
01:23:48.997 --> 01:23:49.573
Yes.

737
01:23:49.853 --> 01:23:52.107
Your dream is to have a job?

738
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:55.181
It's stupid. Why did you do that?

739
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:56.326
It's not stupid.

740
01:23:56.326 --> 01:23:57.629
I love what I do.

741
01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.093
I know what I do with my money

742
01:24:03.824 --> 01:24:05.499
Cooking lessons for my boyfriend

743
01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:08.519
See, see? How do you take me?

744
01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:14.667
You need something more than money to learn to cook

745
01:24:17.246 --> 01:24:18.420
I heard that the search for a chef

746
01:24:18.918 --> 01:24:20.028
the animal shelter

747
01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:29.608
Hey Dom,

748
01:24:35.011 --> 01:24:36.829
I know I have this job tomorrow but ...

749
01:24:39.123 --> 01:24:40.607
you need an extra man

750
01:24:40.845 --> 01:24:42.457
And you Intrii

751
01:24:51.073 --> 01:24:53.189
Will always be family

752
01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:00.168
Thanks

753
01:25:04.246 --> 01:25:05.203
Eat something

754
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.548
Yes

755
01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:17.730
I think you're right

756
01:25:22.732 --> 01:25:24.099
I like to do that?

757
01:25:25.877 --> 01:25:29.154
Ema is a life line that you do not get involved

758
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:35.688
Fair enough

759
01:25:40.108 --> 01:25:42.764
We are 24 hours of the biggest party

760
01:25:44.462 --> 01:25:45.573
You need to drink

761
01:25:45.792 --> 01:25:46.312
It seriously

762
01:25:46.312 --> 01:25:47.563
I'm fine

763
01:25:49.456 --> 01:25:50.391
It can not.

764
01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:53.229
What do you mean?

765
01:25:53.459 --> 01:25:54.437
It can not.

766
01:25:54.981 --> 01:25:56.063
What do you mean can not?

767
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.122
Are you serious?

768
01:26:04.538 --> 01:26:06.418
That's why you let him win?

769
01:26:09.029 --> 01:26:10.192
That's baby gift

770
01:26:10.192 --> 01:26:11.876
No, that helped

771
01:26:12.688 --> 01:26:13.840
Do not take back

772
01:26:14.458 --> 01:26:15.372
Wait, wait

773
01:26:17.059 --> 01:26:18.408
You snapped funrul?

774
01:26:18.408 --> 01:26:19.981
Or it caught ...

775
01:26:22.074 --> 01:26:22.944
Thanks

776
01:26:32.192 --> 01:26:32.918
Did you know?

777
01:26:33.843 --> 01:26:35.605
I have no idea what I'm talking

778
01:26:40.890 --> 01:26:41.705
Toast!

779
01:26:51.478 --> 01:26:53.229
Money comes and goes, everybody knows that

780
01:26:55.548 --> 01:26:57.016
But the most important in life

781
01:26:57.568 --> 01:26:58.939
are people whom I have almost

782
01:27:00.269 --> 01:27:02.128
Here, now

783
01:27:08.762 --> 01:27:10.702
My Family Health

784
01:27:20.162 --> 01:27:20.725
I'm ready

785
01:27:22.616 --> 01:27:24.580
Everything is ok?

786
01:27:27.365 --> 01:27:28.269
All time

787
01:27:32.739 --> 01:27:34.162
Hobbs is the other side of town

788
01:27:36.182 --> 01:27:37.366
We have a window

789
01:27:38.416 --> 01:27:39.445
Folks, it's time

790
01:27:40.899 --> 01:27:42.009
The first team position

791
01:27:42.899 --> 01:27:43.560
Let's go.

792
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.821
S do

793
01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:59.200
Dom, I'll take care of Mia

794
01:28:19.708 --> 01:28:20.708
Police

795
01:28:36.075 --> 01:28:37.326
You just made a big mistake

796
01:28:39.352 --> 01:28:40.684
I took some tracking to find chip

797
01:28:41.822 --> 01:28:43.019
But a little to find the receiver.

798
01:28:43.519 --> 01:28:44.521
You fell, Toretto.

799
01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:45.601
I'm here

800
01:30:14.051 --> 01:30:14.709
Dom!

801
01:30:14.987 --> 01:30:15.492
Stay there

802
01:30:15.492 --> 01:30:16.786
I can handle

803
01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:24.083
Dom, please

804
01:30:31.719 --> 01:30:32.716
Stop

805
01:30:41.799 --> 01:30:42.267
DOM

806
01:31:45.678 --> 01:31:46.224
Yes.

807
01:31:47.659 --> 01:31:48.386
Now we bring

808
01:31:51.599 --> 01:31:52.737
Call the police at the airport

809
01:32:02.053 --> 01:32:02.942
Trap

810
01:32:21.471 --> 01:32:22.577
Warning. Pull

811
01:32:28.816 --> 01:32:29.647
Cover me

812
01:32:35.159 --> 01:32:36.028
Take care of them

813
01:32:48.022 --> 01:32:49.360
Release us! Hai!

814
01:34:49.286 --> 01:34:50.394
You okay? Let's go!

815
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:33.849
Dom, you need to know my son

816
01:35:34.083 --> 01:35:35.130
Nico

817
01:35:40.289 --> 01:35:41.311
I will

818
01:35:44.783 --> 01:35:45.944
It's a good kid

819
01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:51.436
I named her after you

820
01:35:54.091 --> 01:35:55.198
Dominic

821
01:36:02.982 --> 01:36:04.246
You have my word Vince

822
01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:13.215
You will always be my brother

823
01:36:23.719 --> 01:36:25.119
Guard me bro

824
01:36:36.643 --> 01:36:37.841
We need to move, do not have much time

825
01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.777
I know someone who can lead us in 5:00

826
01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:43.774
Not to run

827
01:36:45.992 --> 01:36:47.246
Finish the job

828
01:36:48.355 --> 01:36:50.294
We can not

829
01:36:51.896 --> 01:36:53.180
It's a suicide mission

830
01:36:55.043 --> 01:36:56.509
It's your friend on the table

831
01:36:57.593 --> 01:36:58.917
The plan is ruined

832
01:37:00.464 --> 01:37:01.511
Reyez knows we're coming

833
01:37:02.142 --> 01:37:02.651
He's right

834
01:37:03.622 --> 01:37:04.932
They tripled the police guard

835
01:37:11.047 --> 01:37:12.307
Reyez will not escape

836
01:37:14.184 --> 01:37:15.339
It's a trap, you know

837
01:37:17.894 --> 01:37:19.184
Dom, I listen

838
01:37:20.305 --> 01:37:21.353
Run before it's too late

839
01:37:21.664 --> 01:37:24.059
Get out of Rio, being free

840
01:37:27.338 --> 01:37:28.497
This is not freedom

841
01:37:30.914 --> 01:37:32.010
You should know that

842
01:37:39.166 --> 01:37:40.846
We can make your own choices

843
01:37:43.622 --> 01:37:44.914
I shit myself

844
01:37:54.312 --> 01:37:55.795
I'm coming with you Toretto

845
01:37:59.356 --> 01:38:01.183
Listen to one who will kill the bastard

846
01:38:10.164 --> 01:38:11.554
Dom What's the plan?

847
01:38:13.091 --> 01:38:14.370
We can not sneak

848
01:38:15.919 --> 01:38:17.465
We sneak

849
01:38:19.246 --> 01:38:20.998
Cares only about money

850
01:38:22.392 --> 01:38:24.869
If I take it, we got him

851
01:38:42.985 --> 01:38:43.949
See?

852
01:38:45.824 --> 01:38:47.308
I called on all

853
01:38:49.745 --> 01:38:50.747
We cover

854
01:38:54.216 --> 01:38:55.276
We have people at each entrance

855
01:38:55.619 --> 01:38:57.327
Not even God could not take your money

856
01:38:58.290 --> 01:38:59.742
God is not interested

857
01:39:12.435 --> 01:39:13.231
Are you ready?

858
01:39:15.845 --> 01:39:17.120
I'm ready

859
01:40:14.502 --> 01:40:15.669
I'm here

860
01:40:16.751 --> 01:40:18.254
Come quickly!

861
01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:37.798
Let me go.

862
01:40:48.014 --> 01:40:49.294
Do not move.

863
01:40:49.705 --> 01:40:50.923
Sit down.

864
01:41:21.937 --> 01:41:22.942
What's up, Mia?

865
01:41:23.468 --> 01:41:24.906
Go two streets before

866
01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:26.421
Turn right

867
01:41:26.421 --> 01:41:27.358
I understand

868
01:41:50.127 --> 01:41:51.081
The plan goes.

869
01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:52.835
You have all the police after you.

870
01:41:56.981 --> 01:41:57.659
Where to go?

871
01:41:57.659 --> 01:41:59.224
Go ahead for 1 km.

872
01:41:59.583 --> 01:42:01.324
Then turn left.

873
01:42:06.789 --> 01:42:07.601
It will not work.

874
01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:10.610
Stakes in front of the Duomo.

875
01:42:11.468 --> 01:42:12.770
We are right.

876
01:42:14.502 --> 01:42:15.502
It's too tight. We will not fit.

877
01:42:16.068 --> 01:42:17.279
We have no choice. Now.

878
01:42:37.626 --> 01:42:38.977
Damn!

879
01:42:47.816 --> 01:42:49.141
You went through a bank?

880
01:42:58.622 --> 01:42:59.592
Where are we going?

881
01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:03.205
Do you have a heavy left.

882
01:43:03.205 --> 01:43:04.253
I saw

883
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:24.658
Good job

884
01:44:32.481 --> 01:44:33.983
Do you have a large group of people

885
01:44:34.185 --> 01:44:35.419
You need to do something now.

886
01:44:38.879 --> 01:44:39.781
Go right

887
01:45:13.412 --> 01:45:13.977
YES

888
01:45:28.518 --> 01:45:29.764
I can not escape!

889
01:45:39.457 --> 01:45:40.739
No escape

890
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.803
We will not succeed.

891
01:45:51.944 --> 01:45:53.242
You're right, we will not succeed.

892
01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:55.206
But you did.

893
01:45:57.084 --> 01:45:57.659
What are you talking about?

894
01:45:57.659 --> 01:45:59.087
Let safe. Get out of there.

895
01:45:59.394 --> 01:46:00.739
You are now my father, Brian

896
01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.518
Dom, do not! Keep up the plan

897
01:46:03.895 --> 01:46:05.127
That was the plan

898
01:46:05.897 --> 01:46:07.238
Take care of Mia. Dom!

899
01:46:07.581 --> 01:46:09.414
Listen to me. Leave now safe!

900
01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:35.501
I got it

901
01:47:29.459 --> 01:47:30.537
Do something, bitch!

902
01:47:40.807 --> 01:47:41.739
Kill him, damn!

903
01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:07.604
I thought I told you to leave.

904
01:49:11.115 --> 01:49:12.231
I had to make a call.

905
01:49:30.757 --> 01:49:31.365
Help me.

906
01:49:34.617 --> 01:49:35.866
This is for my team, you bastard.

907
01:49:40.823 --> 01:49:41.818
You made a mess.

908
01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:43.428
Yes.

909
01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.212
As I see it,

910
01:49:53.483 --> 01:49:55.165
You must surrender within 24 hours

911
01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:57.554
Money remains

912
01:49:59.011 --> 01:50:00.428
If I were you, take advantage of time

913
01:50:11.992 --> 01:50:13.105
Tomorrow, I will find

914
01:50:25.074 --> 01:50:25.865
Toretto

915
01:50:27.388 --> 01:50:28.490
See you soon

916
01:50:31.232 --> 01:50:32.181
There ...

917
01:51:15.017 --> 01:51:15.767
Thanks guys.

918
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:17.324
See you on the other side.

919
01:51:22.749 --> 01:51:24.202
We have a window of 10 seconds.

920
01:51:25.123 --> 01:51:25.997
You can get out.

921
01:52:09.706 --> 01:52:10.811
Come on, do not be evil

922
01:53:26.892 --> 01:53:27.916
For Rosa and Nico

923
01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.635
See you soon, Uncle Dom

924
01:53:36.822 --> 01:53:37.745
Monaco

925
01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:39.277
Over here baby

926
01:54:43.243 --> 01:54:44.356
I'll be right

927
01:54:46.573 --> 01:54:47.572
That's your dream?

928
01:54:48.841 --> 01:54:49.568
I get

929
01:54:50.923 --> 01:54:52.525
What are you doing?

930
01:54:53.967 --> 01:54:54.539
Are you okay?

931
01:54:54.765 --> 01:54:55.511
Yes, yes

932
01:54:56.467 --> 01:54:57.334
You know what's crazy?

933
01:55:00.838 --> 01:55:01.573
There are only four copies worldwide car

934
01:55:01.804 --> 01:55:03.433
And I'm only in the Western Hemisphere

935
01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:06.259
We made an offer he could not refuse

936
01:55:10.473 --> 01:55:11.446
You have a beautiful lady. Absolutely

937
01:55:14.335 --> 01:55:15.575
We must go. S do.

938
01:55:16.976 --> 01:55:18.075
Well I drive

939
01:55:18.824 --> 01:55:20.356
In this? I do not think

940
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:23.889
Not this. In that.

941
01:55:31.494 --> 01:55:32.512
Really?

942
01:55:33.745 --> 01:55:34.726
It's crazy

943
01:55:34.943 --> 01:55:35.540
Yes

944
01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:38.674
So are second in the Western Hemisphere

945
01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:44.444
You know what?

946
01:55:44.693 --> 01:55:46.040
We shine together

947
01:55:47.087 --> 01:55:48.240
Dress up. We have something to do

948
01:56:01.431 --> 01:56:03.120
Where are we going? Do not know

949
01:56:04.693 --> 01:56:06.013
I've never been in Madrid.

950
01:56:07.403 --> 01:56:08.525
I thought you wanted to go in Tokyo

951
01:56:10.007 --> 01:56:11.039
We arrive and there ....

952
01:56:12.114 --> 01:56:13.400
eventually

953
01:57:03.311 --> 01:57:04.222
Gosh

954
01:57:28.973 --> 01:57:30.396
I have not seen my sister so happy

955
01:57:32.315 --> 01:57:33.522
It's good to be free

956
01:57:48.317 --> 01:57:49.409
I want a chance

957
01:57:53.742 --> 01:57:54.487
Yes?

958
01:57:56.317 --> 01:57:56.972
Yes.

959
01:57:58.178 --> 01:58:01.381
Only two of us, once and for all.

960
01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:11.814
You can bear your disappointment?

961
01:58:12.296 --> 01:58:13.299
What about you?

962
01:58:16.361 --> 01:58:17.625
O'Conner

963
01:58:18.347 --> 01:58:21.582
Let's see what you can.
