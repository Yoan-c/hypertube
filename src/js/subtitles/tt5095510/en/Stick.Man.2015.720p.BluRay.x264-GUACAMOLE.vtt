00:01:26.228 --> 00:01:28.106
Santa's been!

2
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.368
<i>Stick Man lives in the family tree...</i>

3
00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.973
<i>...with his Stick Lady Love...</i>

4
00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:52.791
<i>...and their stick children three.</i>

5
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.501
Sorry.

6
00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.097
<i>One day, he wakes early and goes for a jog.</i>

7
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.770
Hello!

8
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.417
There you go.

9
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.926
Stick Man!

10
00:04:10.203 --> 00:04:13.400
Stick Man! Beware of the...

11
00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:17.822
...dog!

12
00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:23.608
- A stick?
- Barks the dog.

13
00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:26.727
An excellent stick!

14
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.051
The right kind of stick
for my favorite trick!

15
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:41.904
I'll fetch it and drop it
and fetch it and then...

16
00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:45.197
...I'll drop it and fetch it
and drop it again!

17
00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.227
Come on.

18
00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:19.173
I'm not a stick. Why can't you see?

19
00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:22.020
- I'm Stick Man.
- Yeah?

20
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.570
- I'm Stick Man.
- Yeah?

21
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.533
That's me.

22
00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:34.127
And I want to go home to the family tree.

23
00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:45.103
- <i>A notice says...</i>
- Dogs must be kept on the lead.

24
00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:53.827
<i>At last, the game's over
and Stick Man is freed.</i>

25
00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:07.097
<i>He sets off for home with a hop and a twirl.</i>

26
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.715
Stick Man!

27
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:13.867
Stick Man! Beware of the girl!

28
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:22.103
- A stick!
- <i>Cries the girl, with a smile on her face.</i>

29
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.520
The right kind of pooh stick
for winning the race!

30
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.530
- Has everyone got one?
- Get ready to play!

31
00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.573
- It's one...
- Two, three.

32
00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.995
- Into the river they... go!
- Go!

33
00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:07.566
Yes!

34
00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:14.770
I'm not a pooh stick. Why can't they see?

35
00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.927
I'm Stick Man.

36
00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:20.870
I'm Stick Man. I'm Stick Man.

37
00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:26.489
That's... me.

38
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:49.103
And I'm heading away from the family tree.

39
00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:55.421
<i>Stick Man is swimming. He swims on and on.</i>

40
00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.203
Cool.

41
00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:14.103
All right.

42
00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:23.737
Bye.

43
00:08:28.997 --> 00:08:30.673
Ribbit!

44
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.773
Thanks. Bye.

45
00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:39.727
What?

46
00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:43.803
- Stick Man! Stick Man!
- Hello.

47
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.330
Beware of the swan!

48
00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:55.149
- A twig!
- <i>Says the swan.</i>

49
00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.503
This twig is the best.

50
00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:06.673
It's the right kind of twig
to weave into my nest.

51
00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:12.483
I'm not a twig. Why can't they see...

52
00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:15.403
I'm Stick Man!

53
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.103
Stick... Man!

54
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.664
I'm Stick Man!

55
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.270
That's me!

56
00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:45.463
I'm not a twig. Why can't they see?

57
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.430
I'm Stick Man.

58
00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:55.179
I'm Stick Man.

59
00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:59.127
I'm Stick Man. That's me.

60
00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:13.326
And I long to be back in the family tree.

61
00:11:32.617 --> 00:11:36.808
<i>The nest is deserted and Stick Man is free.</i>

62
00:11:44.567 --> 00:11:46.897
<i>He drifts down the river...</i>

63
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.511
<i>...and sails out to sea.</i>

64
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.281
<i>He tosses and turns,
till the frolicking foam...</i>

65
00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:34.747
<i>...washes him up on a beach...</i>

66
00:13:34.827 --> 00:13:36.993
<i>...far from home.</i>

67
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.681
- Here comes our dad!
- With a spade in his hand!

68
00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.384
Stick Man? Stick Man!

69
00:14:29.467 --> 00:14:31.338
Beware of the sand!

70
00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:38.083
- A mast!
- <i>Yells the dad.</i>

71
00:14:38.163 --> 00:14:40.411
An excellent mast!

72
00:14:42.504 --> 00:14:45.281
There's a flag on our castle at last!

73
00:14:57.733 --> 00:14:59.284
Hey!

74
00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:10.378
I'm not a mast forever! Silly old flag!

75
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.441
Or a sword for a knight.

76
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.441
Or a hook for a bag.

77
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.681
I'm not a pen.

78
00:15:37.567 --> 00:15:39.778
I'm not a bow.

79
00:15:42.017 --> 00:15:44.058
I'm not a bat.

80
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.641
Or a boomerang!

81
00:15:54.117 --> 00:15:55.678
No!

82
00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:00.844
- I'm...
- Stick Man! Stick Man!

83
00:16:00.933 --> 00:16:02.984
Beware of the...

84
00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:07.144
...snow.

85
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.211
<i>Here comes a boy in a warm woolly scarf.</i>

86
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.581
An arm for my snowman!

87
00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:16.678
<i>He says with a laugh.</i>

88
00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:27.384
I'm not an arm.

89
00:16:27.867 --> 00:16:30.138
Can nobody see?

90
00:16:35.067 --> 00:16:37.238
I'm Stick Man.

91
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.581
I'm Stick Man.

92
00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:47.358
I'm Stick Man.

93
00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:49.814
That's me.

94
00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:58.944
Will I ever get back to the...

95
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.441
...family tree?

96
00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:01.484
<i>Stick Man is lonely.</i>

97
00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:04.478
<i>Stick Man is lost.</i>

98
00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:09.158
<i>Stick Man is frozen and covered in frost.</i>

99
00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:20.708
<i>Stick Man is weary.</i>

100
00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.714
<i>His eyes start to close.</i>

101
00:18:26.867 --> 00:18:30.608
<i>He stretches and yawns
and lies down for a doze.</i>

102
00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:38.338
<i>He can't hear the bells
or the sweet-singing choir...</i>

103
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.778
- <i>...or the voice saying...</i>
- Here's a good stick for the fire.

104
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.831
<i>Stick Man is lying asleep in the grate.</i>

105
00:19:05.633 --> 00:19:08.984
<i>Can anyone wake him before it's too late?</i>

106
00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:28.544
<i>He dreams of his kids
and his Stick Lady love...</i>

107
00:20:10.067 --> 00:20:11.978
<i>...then suddenly awakes.</i>

108
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.341
What's that noise up above?

109
00:20:25.233 --> 00:20:28.484
<i>It starts as a chuckle then turns to a shout.</i>

110
00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:33.788
I'm stuck. Get me out.

111
00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.608
A stuck man?

112
00:20:44.367 --> 00:20:46.588
A stuck man.

113
00:20:46.983 --> 00:20:49.334
Now, who could that be?

114
00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:52.578
- Don't worry!
- <i>Cries Stick Man.</i>

115
00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:54.908
I'll soon set you free!

116
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.911
<i>A scratch and a scrape...</i>

117
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.711
<i>...and a flurry of soot...</i>

118
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.978
<i>...a wiggle, a jiggle, and out pokes a foot.</i>

119
00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:15.578
<i>A shove and a nudge, a hop and a jump...</i>

120
00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:24.084
<i>...and Santa falls
into the room with a thump.</i>

121
00:21:37.183 --> 00:21:38.584
Stick Man?

122
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.381
Stick Man! You excellent friend!

123
00:21:49.533 --> 00:21:52.114
Thanks! Thanks a million!

124
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.201
Thanks without end!

125
00:23:35.683 --> 00:23:38.964
<i>Then Stick Man helped Santa
deliver the toys...</i>

126
00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:43.958
<i>...to fast-asleep girls...</i>

127
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.703
<i>...and to fast-asleep boys.</i>

128
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.111
There you go.

129
00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:01.844
<i>Faster and faster
they fly through the snow...</i>

130
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.691
- <i>...until Santa says...</i>
- Only one chimney to go.

131
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.921
<i>Stick Lady's lonely. The children are sad.</i>

132
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.381
<i>It won't feel like Christmas
without their stick dad.</i>

133
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:39.708
<i>They toss and they turn in the family bed.</i>

134
00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:50.578
<i>But...</i>

135
00:24:51.917 --> 00:24:54.528
What is that clattering sound overhead?

136
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.811
Someone is tumbling into our house.

137
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.841
- Is it a bird?
- Or a bat?

138
00:25:04.117 --> 00:25:06.558
Or a mouse?

139
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.381
Or could it...

140
00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:18.468
Yes. Could it just possibly be...

141
00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:25.858
I'm Stick Man.

142
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.241
I'm Stick Man.

143
00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:30.414
I'm Stick Man.

144
00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:35.515
That's me.

145
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.941
And I'm sticking right here
in the family tree.
