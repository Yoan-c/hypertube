1
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.289
Listen up, pledges!

2
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.046
This frat's Halloween parties
have always been epic.

3
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.360
Epic!

4
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.681
And this year will be no exception.

5
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.206
My reputation is on the line.

6
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.602
So if I fail, you all fail.

7
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.206
And we all know that Jonathan
doesn't fail, right?

8
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.401
- Right!
- Got it?

9
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.606
Got it.

10
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.207
You see? Now this is why I know
that tonight's gonna be epic, fellas.

11
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.567
Would somebody wake him up?

12
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.041
- Horse, hey.
- Wake up!

13
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.361
The Horse is always up, man.

14
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.284
Bean Boy.
Tell your president what today is.

15
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.044
It's Halloween time, sir!

16
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.921
And why is Halloween so important
to this frat's reputation, Bean?

17
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.321
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we have the longest tradition

18
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.323
of throwing the best
Halloween parties ever, sir.

19
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.006
And what will be your contribution be

20
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.971
to make sure that tonight
is the best party ever?

21
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.283
I've been recruiting
some of the best talent on campus.

22
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.050
This is pledgee Cummings.

23
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.442
Studies film makeup, sir.
Best in my class.

24
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.045
How's it going, man... Sir?

25
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.851
And I found this guy.
Pledgee Mond...

26
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.290
Mondon!
Mondon! Oh.

27
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.089
This is pledge Mondon, everyone.

28
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.367
- Whoa.
- Weird name, cool guy.

29
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.410
This guy can hack into anything.
I mean, anything.

30
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.856
- Nice.
- K? Remember last year?

31
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.450
When he hacked into the Beta Sorority?

32
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.204
- Yes! Yes!
- Into the webcams?

33
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.376
I remember that.

34
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.526
- I remember that.
- Yeah!

35
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.525
Very illegal, kind of creepy.
But very fun, nonetheless.

36
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.404
Dude, can we do that again?
I was so happy.

37
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.324
Breathe. Take a breath.
That's why I got him.

38
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.762
And, sir, this is pledgee
Wells and Dimps,

39
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.251
and they are very special.

40
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.084
Pledgees, show them.

41
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.730
All right!

42
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.444
Ladies alert! Ladies alert!

43
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.680
- Oh, that's them. That's them.
- Ladies alert!

44
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.409
These are college guys.

45
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.211
- Ladies!
- What up, boys?

46
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.770
- Damn.
- Hi.

47
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.127
Hey. I'm Renaldo,
but my friends call me Horse

48
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.247
- I'm Rain, and this is my friend.
- Leah.

49
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.810
I'm Tiffany.

50
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.723
- My name's Aday.
- I'm Jonathan,

51
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.768
the <i>El</i> Presidente
of this here fraterni-tay.

52
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.726
Well, what's up with you ladies?

53
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.531
You are now staring
at Upsilon Theta's finest.

54
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.762
You girls go to school here?

55
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.365
- No. No.
- No.

56
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.171
- No, we go to St. Mary's.
- Oh, that's what's up.

57
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.527
St. Mary's, that's
an all-girl college, right?

58
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.809
So y'all probably never seen
a dude before in real life.

59
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.407
This right here,
this is what a dude looks like.

60
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.165
All right, look.
We're having a Halloween party tonight,

61
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.322
- and it's gonna be...
- Epic!

62
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.970
- Oh, well...
- Epic.

63
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.687
Um...

64
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.647
Concussion.

65
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.496
So why don't
you ladies come on by

66
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.170
and be Jonathan's special guest?

67
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.480
What time?

68
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.920
The party starts at 10:00,
so come when you like.

69
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.088
- Oh, I don't know about...
- We'll see you tonight.

70
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.280
Give me your phone.
I'll put my number in.

71
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.966
Tiffany, there's your dad.

72
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.445
Chill out. Chill.

73
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.363
- Rain, Leah, Aday...
- Hi.

74
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.488
- Hi, Mr. Simmons.
- So hot.

75
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.642
Daddy issues.

76
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.489
Tiffany, what's going on?

77
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.085
Hey, Old Man River,

78
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.640
ain't you got some pigeons
to feed or something? Take a hike.

79
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.131
I'm sorry. Old Man River?

80
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.416
Who you talking to, son?
Who you talking to?

81
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.726
Do you see your grandpa here?

82
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.529
Have you looked in the mirror, son?

83
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.682
You're in college
and you look like you're 67, okay?

84
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.489
- Bring it. You bring it.
- Dino...

85
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.881
- I want you to bring it so badly.
- Dino.

86
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.496
I will whoop your ass.
You understand that?

87
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.726
I will whoop your <i>ass.</i>

88
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.441
Dad, he's pretty big.
He is the star lineman on the team.

89
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.726
Pfft! Look at me.

90
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.564
- I play...
- Tennis.

91
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.530
In high school, 30 years ago.

92
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.204
Chill out, pops. It's cool.

93
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.408
Who are you? Thor?
Did Thor just...

94
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.562
What the hell are you telling me,
"Chill out, pops"?

95
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.564
You don't tell me to chill out, okay?
That's my daughter, son.

96
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.936
Son, Fabio, whatever.

97
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.564
Nobody's talking to you.

98
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.166
Go somewhere, grow your hair
and stay out of this, okay?

99
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.560
Sir, I'll take
care of them, okay?

100
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.846
Back to the frat house.

101
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.571
You see?

102
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.530
It won't happen again, sir.
I'm so sorry. Bye, girls.

103
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.376
Tiffany,
how many times have I told you

104
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.845
not to walk past this frat house?

105
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.456
Well, we were just
walking by, Mr. Simmons,

106
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.845
and they stopped us.

107
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.256
- It's not our fault.
- We didn't do anything.

108
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.536
You're coming home.
Get in the car.

109
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.846
No. No, no, no, no, guys.

110
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.763
There's no room in there
for all of us.

111
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.696
The house is right there.
We're just gonna walk.

112
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.370
Tiffany, get in the car.

113
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.284
It's right there. We can walk.
Come on. Come on.

114
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.601
Come on.

115
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.011
- Bye, Mr. Simmons.
- Bye!

116
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.605
He seems angry.

117
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.648
She never listens to you.

118
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.603
So you know my mom used to
teach theater in school, right?

119
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.736
So I have all these
really cool costumes in the attic.

120
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.684
We're gonna come up with something
so hot for the party tonight.

121
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.649
- Hot?
- Do you know your dad?

122
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.245
He's not gonna let you go.

123
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.402
Just let me deal with that, okay?

124
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.936
Just meet me here at 10:00
and we can figure it out from there.

125
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.486
- Okay.
- I don't know.

126
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.324
She's coming. You're coming.

127
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.606
I am so excited.

128
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.011
I know, this is gonna be so wild.

129
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.643
- Bye, girls!
- Bye!

130
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.563
Oh, Lord.
I don't know about this.

131
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.244
You're coming. Come on.

132
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.322
We gotta figure out
what we're gonna wear.

133
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.402
- Ohh!
- Gonna be so fun!

134
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.051
There's gonna be
boys there. I don't like that.

135
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.930
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not so fast. Not so fast.

136
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.321
Listen to me.
How many times do I have to tell you?

137
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.562
Do not walk past that frat house.

138
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.016
You're out there,
you're talking to those guys.

139
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.280
They are college kids.

140
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.656
You're 17 years old, you're not
supposed to be talking to them.

141
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.241
Do you understand me?
And what do you have on? What is this?

142
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.448
Tiffany, I'm gonna tell you
one more time.

143
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.966
Do not take your uniform off

144
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.328
until you get into this house.
Are we clear?

145
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.368
Leah and Rain's mom lets them do it.

146
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.408
I am not Leah or Rain's parent.

147
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.005
I am your parent.
Do you understand?

148
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.361
And what I tell you,
you have to learn to listen to.

149
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.566
I don't want you to do it.

150
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.483
Okay, then buy me a car

151
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.176
so I won't have to
walk past the frat house.

152
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.896
Do you hear yourself?
I'm not buying you a car.

153
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.366
That makes no sense to me.
I'm not buying you a car.

154
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.284
- You have to finish school...
- Finish school. I... Yeah...

155
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.016
- Do not mock me.
- Do not mock me.

156
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.008
- Tiffany! Stop!
- Tiffany! Stop!

157
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.525
Stop... You...

158
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.130
Then stop talking.

159
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.370
I'm an adult, I can say
what I wanna say in this house.

160
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.766
Do you understand?

161
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.256
I can say what I wanna say

162
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.776
and what I'm telling you
right now is this.

163
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.564
You have to watch out
for those college kids.

164
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.880
Those boys want one thing...

165
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.361
Um, one thing
and what's that thing?

166
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.096
The thing is for somebody
to pay their student loans.

167
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.727
Now go upstairs and finish your...
Do something and get packed.

168
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.450
Okay, Dad, sure.

169
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.480
But I know you're not talking
about student loans.

170
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.726
Go get packed.

171
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.086
Packed?
Where is he going?

172
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.924
He and you, you're both
going to your mom's.

173
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.736
I have work to do, so you
and your brother are going.

174
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.886
She's coming to pick you up.

175
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.486
I'm 17, I do not
have to go to my mom's.

176
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.006
I am not leaving you
in this house on Halloween.

177
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.289
I don't care if you're 17,
you're not staying here alone.

178
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.089
Okay, well then
Aday can stay with me.

179
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.366
How about that?

180
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.090
- I will?
- Yes, you will.

181
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.050
Oh, actually, my parents wouldn't mind
me staying here for Halloween.

182
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.124
- We don't celebrate it anyways.
- My dad...

183
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.896
Well, I think he'd actually
be okay with it, actually,

184
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.003
because every Halloween,
we just go to church.

185
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.050
- To church?
- Yes, church on Halloween, sir.

186
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.176
Actually, a lot of the parents
don't like their children

187
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.966
celebrating the Devil's holiday with
the ghosts and the goblins and whatnot.

188
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.536
So they bring their children to church.

189
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.450
They get dressed up
in holy costumes and Bible characters.

190
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.176
You know, last year
I was actually the Ghost.

191
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.441
Wait, you just said
they don't celebrate ghosts.

192
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.045
Oh, no, the Holy Ghost.

193
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.771
Yeah, and then we also have
a carnival, as well.

194
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.446
We give candy out to the children
so they don't feel left out.

195
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.443
And the adults,
they have a prayer service.

196
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.736
And it's all good, it's all jolly
and we just love getting together...

197
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.921
Okay. Okay, all right.

198
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.445
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.176
- Please go ahead and call him.
- No, no, no.

200
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.440
Thank you very much.

201
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.976
But no, I'm not leaving you
in this house.

202
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.696
No, okay, there's no way
I'm going to Mom's.

203
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.927
Absolutely no, no, no, no, no.

204
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.527
No way. We're staying.
So call her dad.

205
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.406
- Come on, Aday.
- Ooh.

206
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.527
I do not know about this party tonight.

207
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.690
- I don't wanna go.
- No, it'll be fun. Okay, listen.

208
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.610
We have to go.
Girl, we cannot stay in this house.

209
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.489
Leah and Rain are going.
It'll be fun.

210
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.449
But, I... It's just...

211
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.161
No! No, but nothing, okay? Come on. Sit.

212
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.447
Listen, they like us.

213
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.722
And they're the most
popular girls in school.

214
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.882
- Popular...
- Okay? We can't not go

215
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.645
and be right where we were
when we first got to that school.

216
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.722
They're popular because
they wear those baby shirts

217
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.609
that shows what the Good Lord gave 'em.

218
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.648
Plus, why do they have to set the trend?

219
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.486
Okay, number one,
those baby shirts are called crop tops.

220
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.040
And did you see how those guys
were drooling over them?

221
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.441
Did you see how they were
drooling over you?

222
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.921
Because I took notes from them.

223
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.570
Okay. Come on.
We gotta go to the attic,

224
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.529
create something
really hot for tonight.

225
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.250
- Let's get.
- Hot...

226
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.401
Wait.

227
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.684
- He's texting me.
- Who's texting you?

228
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.649
Jonathan, the cute frat boy.

229
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.768
I thought that boy
was staring at Rain.

230
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.606
He was, for now. Come on.

231
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.005
- For now?
- Yeah.

232
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.565
<i>She needs to stay with me.</i>

233
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.136
Debra, I already told her that, okay?
She doesn't wanna stay with you.

234
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.606
<i>You're her dad,
you need to put your foot down.</i>

235
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.886
<i>Are you listening?</i>

236
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.121
Yes, I'm listening to you.

237
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.645
- <i>Well?</i>
- Yeah, I know I'm her dad.

238
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.960
You're her mom, okay?

239
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.684
- I can't...
- <i>Get</i> her ready!

240
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.616
She doesn't wanna come,
she doesn't have to come.

241
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.136
- <i>She doesn't</i> wanna go...
<i>- But she needs to.</i>

242
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.731
All right, listen. Just come...
Come and pick BJ up.

243
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.690
- I don't wanna argue about this.
- Now I'm on my way.

244
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.884
Tiffany, somebody...

245
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.371
The hell?

246
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.880
This girl.

247
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.644
Open your little bag up wide.

248
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.087
So I can drop it
all the way down to the bottom.

249
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.576
I don't even know why
you sitting out here with these...

250
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.056
What you doing with these canes, Bam?

251
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.127
Trick or treat!

252
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.645
Mabel...

253
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.121
You know I had hip surgery.
I need these canes.

254
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.696
You don't need them canes,
stop that lying.

255
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.056
I seen you running
up and down the street.

256
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.570
Mabel, I need these canes,

257
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.563
and let me tell you,
they were high as hell, too.

258
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.962
Too much for a woman on a fixed income
and I ain't got no extra money

259
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.281
to be wasting on no canes like these.

260
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.648
So I gotta use these so that I don't
have to go back to the hospital.

261
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.816
I know them
two little girls right there.

262
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.365
If you... Hold on
just a second, honey.

263
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.096
If you're so worried
about money on a fixed income,

264
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.616
why the hell are you out here
giving these little heathens candy?

265
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.610
- Mabel, I like this.
- No, Bam, uh-uh. No.

266
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.336
This is why I'm not
in my damn house right now.

267
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.567
- What?
- I don't like no doggone Halloween.

268
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.776
I'm not gonna be giving them children
no candy for free. Hell!

269
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.406
When I was growing up, do you know
what I had to do for candy?

270
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.656
Do you know
what I had to do for candy?

271
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.886
What, Mabel?

272
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.684
I had to give up candy to get candy.

273
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.330
That's why.
But I'm not gonna do that,

274
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.289
spend my hard-earned money
on no candy gifting.

275
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.567
It's going in my retirement,
my Ho-O-1-K.

276
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.563
I'm not gonna do it,
give no child no candy.

277
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.847
Mabel, what is Ho-O-1-K?

278
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.410
It's for hoes.

279
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.245
It's for all of those women
who never ever

280
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.210
were able to pay taxes on their money
because they got it illegally.

281
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.762
So you put the money aside.
It's not a 401 K, it's a Ho-O-1-K.

282
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.056
- That's why I got a Ho-O-1-K.
- Oh!

283
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.401
Yeah, from back in the day
when I was stripping.

284
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.200
- I wonder why...
- When I was on that pole.

285
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.130
I'm not gonna spend
my Ho-O-1-K on nobody.

286
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.336
No, I'm not gonna do that,
giving no children no candy.

287
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.010
I don't know why you doing it.

288
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.256
Now, see, look at this.
Look at this.

289
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.681
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

290
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.683
Look at his little outfit!

291
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.206
Here you go!
Here you go, baby, right here.

292
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.327
What's he supposed to be?

293
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.686
He's a G.I.

294
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.807
Thank you.

295
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.967
You're welcome.

296
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.326
He salute.

297
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.686
Yeah.

298
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.211
- Barn.
- I like them a bit...

299
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.282
- Barn. I saw your ass.
- Yeah.

300
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.726
Saw me do what?

301
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.006
Bam!

302
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.765
Barn, I saw you drop
a little piece of candy up in there

303
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.336
and take four or five pieces
out of that baby bag.

304
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.089
- What the hell?
- Shh!

305
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.730
Is that what you out here doing?

306
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.404
Mabel, shh!

307
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.296
- Why you doing that?
- Mabel, sometimes you get

308
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.722
the munchies after you smoke, honey,
and this candy be coming in handy.

309
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.043
And lookit, I been doing this for years.

310
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.400
- Barn.
- What?

311
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.811
You high now, ain't you?

312
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.403
Yeah.

313
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.405
Uh-uh. Mabel, look, don't judge me.
I got a prescription.

314
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.723
I'm so glad, I was so glad
when this thing finally came!

315
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.447
Hey! I can't wait
to show it to the police.

316
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.885
Put that away, Bam.

317
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.296
Sitting here high,
taking candy from babies.

318
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.656
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

319
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.856
Well, you gotta teach them something.

320
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.536
You gotta teach 'em something
and you gotta teach them at some time.

321
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.050
I don't like this Halloween stuff.

322
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.565
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

323
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.416
I'm the trick, she the treat.
Now go the hell on.

324
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.204
Why they got that boy
dressed like a cow?

325
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.009
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

326
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.096
Got that child dressed
like chocolate milk in a box.

327
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.485
- Mabel!
- What?

328
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.767
Don't do that.
You gonna scar this baby.

329
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.296
But you better watch him, Bam.

330
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.616
- Mmm-mmm.
- Uh-uh, you better watch him,

331
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.210
- he look like Biggie, Barn.
- Mmm-mmm.

332
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.360
That's a O.G. right there.
I'm telling you right now.

333
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.496
- Mabel!
- What? I'm telling you,

334
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.760
you better watch him.

335
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.410
He... He ain't gonna fall for that.

336
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.164
He counting every one
of them damn candies.

337
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.651
He ain't counting calories,

338
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.882
but he counting them damn candies.

339
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.291
Shut your mouth, will you?

340
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.616
I'm telling you, you better be careful,

341
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.369
Rick Ross gonna get you.

342
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.847
Hey, baby. Don't mind her at all.
You just come stay right there.

343
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.207
Let me pick and see
which one I'm gonna give you.

344
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.727
- I'm gonna give you two of these.
- You about to get stabbed.

345
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.896
- Look at this. Here you go!
- That boy ain't playing.

346
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.809
Put it down here
so I can put it in there.

347
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.087
Here you go, baby! There you go.

348
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.450
Oh, Lord...

349
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.000
There you go. All right, go on.

350
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.967
Wait a minute.

351
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.286
What'd I tell you?

352
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.488
I had more candy in here than this.

353
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.166
Biggie about to shoot you, Tupac.

354
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.480
I don't... I don't know what...

355
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.722
I have no idea
what you talking about.

356
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.811
You took candy
from my pumpkin, grandma.

357
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.009
No, I didn't do that, baby.
Why would I do that? Mabel?

358
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.491
You tricked me.

359
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.250
You put candy in
but took a handful out.

360
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.401
What... Did you do that?

361
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.841
Did you see me do that?
Listen, let me tell you something.

362
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.446
You need to teach your son
these principles at home, honey.

363
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.251
That's why they call it
"trick or treat."

364
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.967
That is not nice.
What's wrong with you?

365
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.896
Hold on now, you ain't finna be
gettin' on my damn friend.

366
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.365
Let me tell you something, honey.

367
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.807
You gone and had your child
disrespecting her, okay?

368
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.803
If she say she didn't do it,
she didn't do it.

369
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.370
You understand?
We let us... Hold on.

370
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.176
You talk about look at her?
Look at your child.

371
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.123
What about... What about him?
He is just perfect.

372
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.044
What's wrong?
You asking what's wrong with her?

373
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.521
What's wrong with your damn child?

374
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.886
- Mabel. Mabel.
- What?

375
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.086
That baby can hear you.

376
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.810
I don't give a damn if he can hear me.

377
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.216
Come out here, you got him
trick or treating for candy.

378
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.403
You need to have him trick or treating
for a damn treadmill or an elliptical.

379
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.766
- Momma!
- It's okay!

380
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.410
- It's okay! It's okay!
- Come on, bull!

381
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.296
Come on, bull! Come on, bull!

382
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.004
Come on, bull!
Come on, bull!

383
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.890
You run your ass up on me,
I'ma make some steak!

384
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.564
- Mabel.
- What?

385
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.776
They need to learn some time.

386
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.801
- Mabel.
- What?

387
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.530
What the hell is that?
What is that?

388
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.001
Some damn person acting the fool
dressed like a clown.

389
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.650
I don't like this.

390
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.896
They better not come over here with
their foolishness. That's what I know.

391
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.729
Mabel, I'm scared. I don't like this.

392
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.136
- What the hell you scared of?
- Because I don't like this.

393
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.925
Who you know ride up in a box?

394
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.970
And he wind it up, you let something
jump up out of that damn box.

395
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.456
Come over here. My friend is scared.

396
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.576
Don't come over here
with that foolishness.

397
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.840
Don't come over here!

398
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.416
That's gonna make him
come over here, Bam.

399
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.249
- Here he come.
- Hello?

400
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.926
- Hey, Madea. How you doing?
- Hey, Brian. How you doing?

401
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.331
<i>I'm good. I'm good.</i>

402
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.896
Listen, I gotta go
out of town until Sunday

403
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.216
and I was wondering if you can come by
and just keep an eye on Tiffany?

404
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.607
No, son. No, I can't come over there.
It's Halloween night,

405
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.216
you know I don't like to go
nowhere on Halloween.

406
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.456
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>My feet hurting...</i>

407
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.925
I ain't got no gas in my car.

408
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.096
- Okay, great, I get it.
- <i>I got gout in...</i>

409
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.451
<i>Mabel.</i>

410
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.016
Hush, Barn. Calm down.
Don't worry about that fool

411
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.296
coming over here.
Let him come over here.

412
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.136
- I don't like no clowns.
- It's gonna be all right.

413
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.969
Don't come over here.

414
00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.976
You better not come over here
with this foolishness like...

415
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.331
<i>dressed up like a damn clown.</i>

416
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.121
My breast is hurting, my back
is hurting. You know, we hit this age

417
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.056
<i>everything hurts something.
No, son. No, I can't.</i>

418
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.081
<i>I'll</i> pay You-

419
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.083
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in an hour.

420
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.730
That's what I thought.

421
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.480
Look. Look, there. There. There.

422
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.801
Don't come over here
with that damn foolishness.

423
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.484
I'm telling you right now.

424
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.125
- Dea.
- Don't be scared, honey.

425
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.009
Look here, you scaring my friend.

426
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.208
- Mmm-mmm. Look. Mmm-mmm.
- Bam, calm down.

427
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.444
My friend is scared. Y'all need to
go the hell on with all that foo...

428
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.646
Oh, you think I'm playing.

429
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.016
See, now that's what I'm talking about.

430
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.485
Let something jump up out of there.

431
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.006
Let something jump up
out of this damn box.

432
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.525
Let something come up out of there.

433
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.601
Boo!

434
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.163
- Damn, y'all!
- Yeah, you get.

435
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.083
You got knocked the... out.

436
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.481
Damn, Dea.
You ain't got to hit her like that.

437
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.562
- Joe?
- Help me up off this ground.

438
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.768
Hattie?
What the hell wrong with y'all?

439
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.531
Damn, Ma! You ain't had
to punch me like that.

440
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.251
- You lucky I didn't shoot your ass!
- You all right, Hattie?

441
00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.006
Hell, no, I ain't all right.
She just punched me like a damn dude.

442
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.296
The hell wrong with you, Hattie?

443
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.776
You know black people
scared of every damn thing.

444
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.736
- You all right, baby. Walk it off.
- Walk it off?

445
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.046
- Walk it off.
- Walk it off?

446
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.929
- Walk it off.
- I ain't walking nothing off.

447
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.816
Look at Barn out here
shaking like a salt shaker.

448
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.136
Barn always shaking.
Hell, every time she walk, she shaking.

449
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.083
It's called aftershock.

450
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.730
You wrong for that, Ma.

451
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.201
We weren't doing nothing
but trying to scare y'all.

452
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.648
Don't do that, Hattie.
You know I'm scared of everything.

453
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.816
Right, yeah, you know
every time she gets too scared

454
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.844
she drop a tear and if she laugh
too hard, she'll squirt a little pee.

455
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.416
Mabel, you don't have to
keep telling everybody that.

456
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.044
- Well, it's the truth.
- No, it ain't.

457
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.416
Yes. You know you squirt a little pee

458
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.056
- every time you get scared.
- No, I don't!

459
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.600
It's true. You probably wet right now.

460
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.490
- I'll be... I'll be right back.
- See? What I tell you?

461
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.245
Hurry up in there.
We gotta go on over to Brian's house.

462
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.049
Oh, hell, they got drinks over there.

463
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.416
- Drinks?
- Ain't nobody invite you over there.

464
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.816
You ain't getting in my car
till you take them damn clown suits off.

465
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.605
Come on, Joe. Ain't nobody
got to invite me for a drink.

466
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.040
- Hurry up! Hurry up in there, Barn!
- I'm gonna get me one.

467
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.085
Madea, hey.

468
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.164
Hey, there. How you doing, baby?
Good to see you.

469
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.368
I'll tell you about it when you go in.

470
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.171
- You brought my daddy.
- What up, bitch?

471
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.527
Daddy, don't use
that language in this house.

472
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.170
- Hey, Brian!
- Oh, Ms. Hattie, how you doing?

473
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.766
- Hey! Give me a hug.
- Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

474
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.016
I'll pass on that.
I'll pass on that.

475
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.849
- Why?
- You know why!

476
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.686
Every time you hug up on him,
you thrust your pelvis into his.

477
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.604
What? He a grown-ass man,
he can take it.

478
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.526
- I don't want to take it, Ms. Hattie.
- You can take it if you want to, Brian.

479
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.136
I don't want to take it, Ms. Hattie.
Thank you, I don't wanna take it.

480
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.736
Hattie, I know damn well
you are not flirtin'.

481
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.496
Keep it up I'ma knock you
upside your head, hell.

482
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.536
Now, Joe, I done told you
about talkin' at me like that.

483
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.164
You think I'm some baby...

484
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.760
You sit down over there,
shit and hell.

485
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.365
Would y'all stop all that?
Calm down.

486
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.249
Brian, come on, baby, can you please
help me in here to the chairs, baby?

487
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.926
- Help you, sure.
- Yeah. Please, help me in here.

488
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.684
Listen, the steps are
too hard for me now.

489
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.922
- Yes, I know.
- Ever since my hip surgery.

490
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.336
- Didn't know you were coming.
- You didn't know I was coming?

491
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.170
But did you know I had hip surgery?
You know I had hip... Listen.

492
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.720
- Somebody told me.
- That man cut me...

493
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.564
- Did he?
- Yes, he did. Him.

494
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.376
He cut me, Brian,
all the way from down here,

495
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.731
all the way back here...

496
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.296
- mid my apple.
- Hey, you need your cane?

497
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.721
Yeah, I need these canes.
I need 'em. Just set 'em...

498
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.802
Yes, I'm on the canes, now.
I need 'em, yeah.

499
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.531
- But you gave 'em to...
- Yeah, put 'em over there.

500
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.176
Sit 'em up there on the wall,
over there.

501
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.488
Listen, Brian,
but I just thank God...

502
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.131
- Thank God that I'm in my right mind.
- Hmm.

503
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.646
- And that my heart is still beating.
- Hmm.

504
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.131
- Ho!
- Yeah.

505
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.726
Sometimes I can't
hardly pee, though.

506
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.246
Thank you so much for sharing.
I appreciate it, thank you.

507
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.322
Bam, that ain't polite conversation.

508
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.176
You know, just one or two drops,
Mabel, that's it.

509
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.328
Don't nobody wanna hear
about your one or two drops.

510
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.084
I wonder why that is.

511
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.764
It's prostate cancer, that's what it is.

512
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.525
You got that prostate...
You got the prostate cancer.

513
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.409
Joe, shut up!

514
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.256
What the hell you think it is?
What the hell else is it,

515
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.691
if it ain't prostate ca...

516
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.376
That's the only thing keep you from
peein'. She said she get two drops.

517
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.166
One say "prostate," other say "cancer."
Prostate cancer. That's what she got.

518
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.446
- She got it.
- Joe.

519
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.522
Don't no woman have no prostate.

520
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.730
Mabel, you know damn well
you got a prostate.

521
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.800
You know what I'm gonna do?

522
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.256
I'm gonna give you a prostate exam
with this foot right here.

523
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.520
Right here. Say something else.

524
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.840
Hell, you ain't, either.

525
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.604
This here? This ass?
"Do not enter."

526
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.045
Sign on it, tattoo.

527
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.776
- Do not enter back there.
- Hell, no!

528
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.246
- Who the hell you think I am?
- Shut up.

529
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.489
Hello? Can we just focus on
why I asked you to come...

530
00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.296
Who the hell is he,
who the hell he hollerin' at?

531
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.936
You asked me to come over
to your damn house.

532
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.564
Don't be hollerin' at me up in here.

533
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.645
- Don't get gutted up in here.
- Right. Like a fish.

534
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.456
Okay, sorry. Sorry.
I didn't mean that at all.

535
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.563
Yes, that's better. That's better.
Show some apologection up in here.

536
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.246
- Apologection into the room.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

537
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.856
I'm glad you're here
to help me with her,

538
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.376
'cause there's a frat party
around the corner.

539
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.290
And I wanna be sure she doesn't try to
sneak out and go over there, okay?

540
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.443
- She too young for that!
- I know. I...

541
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.364
I don't know about that, I remember
I used to go to a frat party, man.

542
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.569
We had them girls up in there.
Oh! God damn.

543
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.565
- Hell, no. She can't go over there.
- What?

544
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.567
When I was goin' I was 15, baby.
And I was the entertainment, then.

545
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.976
All right, you were
the entertainment, I get it.

546
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.924
Thank you. Okay, listen.
I'm glad you're here. 'Cause I...

547
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.336
I want you to be quiet,
if you don't mind,

548
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.842
'cause I don't want her to know that
you all are here until after I'm gone.

549
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.524
Hold the hell on.

550
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.016
You finna leave, you ain't
gonna tell her you're going?

551
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.327
- Looks like he's scared of her.
- Right.

552
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.016
Damn, boy.
You lettin' a girl run over you?

553
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.690
Look how you
standin' there sweatin'.

554
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.525
- Listen, I...
- These children today.

555
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.896
No, it ain't the children, baby,
it's the parents.

556
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.970
It's these damn parents.
The parents I don't understand.

557
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.804
That's what it is. Right there.

558
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.136
If these parents were getting in charge
of these children here,

559
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.536
we wouldn't be having all these issues.

560
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.804
Come on, you know. Those teenage years,
when they turn into a teenager.

561
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.296
Boy, I remember them
teenage years, baby,

562
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.970
I remember them teenage years.

563
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.849
You got to drop the damn hammer.

564
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.843
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
- Drop the hammer on them.

565
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.285
Them teenage years, hell.

566
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.850
I'm tellin' ya, I keeps me a hammer.

567
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.969
Now we know what the problem is,
anybody in here got a solution?

568
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.976
Is he slow? He don't understand
nothin' I'm saying.

569
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.322
Hattie, can you explain this to him
in a language that he understands?

570
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.006
Whoop. That. Ass.

571
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.490
All in favor say "aye."

572
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.891
- Aye.
- The ayes have it.

573
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.096
- Where she at?
- Where she at?

574
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.045
- I get the switch.
- Sit down. I am not hitting my child.

575
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.691
What? You can't stomach it?

576
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.331
- We'll whoop that ass for you!
- No!

577
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.323
Nobody is hitting my child, okay?

578
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.896
I told them early
you need to whip them kids,

579
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.416
I been tellin' him
since they were little.

580
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.522
"Whoop her! Whoop her!
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!

581
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.736
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!

582
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.842
Whoop her ass! Whoop her ass!"
What'd he do?

583
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.331
He don't whoop her ass.

584
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.404
Listen, we have never spanked our
children, ever. We didn't do that.

585
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.970
We weren't those kind of parents.

586
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.646
- Well, that's the problem right there!
- That's right.

587
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.096
That's right, that's right! Whoop her.
Baby, let me tell you something.

588
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.176
I'm not tellin' you to go up there
and abuse no child.

589
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.376
Even though
I got a hammer in my purse.

590
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.209
I'm just kidding about the hammer.

591
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.281
No, I'm not.

592
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.936
But listen, what I'm trying to get you
to understand is very, very simple, son.

593
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.361
Hear me clearly. A little love tap
ain't never hurt nobody.

594
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.841
- There it is. Love tap.
- A little love tap.

595
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.649
Just tap your child.
A little love tap.

596
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.768
Like I did you,
I gave you lots of love taps.

597
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.285
Lot... What?

598
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.761
Hold on a second,
did you just say "love tap"?

599
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.126
No, no, no, no, no.

600
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.568
That wasn't a love tap,
I was on life support.

601
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.016
Are you...
Are you blaming that on me?

602
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.565
That is not my fault.

603
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.336
What'd I have to do with you
being on life support?

604
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.569
Am I missing something? I was
four years old. Whose fault was it?

605
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.962
I told your ass to stop talking back
to me and what did you do?

606
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.407
I said...
I was talking back.

607
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.529
Right. So when I bust your ass
and you ended up

608
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.960
in the damn life support situation,
whose problem did that belong to?

609
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.844
You better hold up,
she gonna explode her prostate.

610
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.922
Right. That's your own damn fault.

611
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.056
The defense rests, Your Honor.

612
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.256
- Mmm-hmm.
- The case is closed.

613
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.726
Thank you. The jury has been excused.

614
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.616
You guys don't understand, okay?

615
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.008
I know in your day you could do that,
you could beat kids, you could slap 'em,

616
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.536
but this is a different day and time.

617
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.976
You can't spank your kids
these days, okay?

618
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.764
You go to jail
for things like that now.

619
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.763
That's what it is?
You're politically correct.

620
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.650
Let me tell you somethin' about
"you can't hit your kids these days."

621
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.609
And hear me clearly
when I say this to you, son.

622
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.571
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

623
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.736
Daddy, I'm gonna tell you one more time,
stop using that language in this house.

624
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.728
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit!

625
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.165
Joe, shut up!

626
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.811
Stop all that saying all them cuss words
up in here, Joe, hell.

627
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.336
Boy, if I didn't whoop your ass
you know where you'd be right now?

628
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.456
Somewhere strung out on drugs.

629
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.496
You don't know the hell...
trying to get 20 dollars for a fix.

630
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.056
You don't know what the hell
you talkin' 'bout.

631
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.800
That's why you turned out
well like you did.

632
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.056
That's why you're a federal prosecutor.

633
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.736
Hell, I beat you so much you were scared
to look at a damn crack pipe.

634
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.216
You ain't know
what a damn crack pipe was.

635
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.004
You know what a crack pipe
is now, don't you?

636
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.776
See, he still don't know
what the hell a crack pipe is.

637
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.485
You know why that is?
'Cause I beat your <i>ass.</i>

638
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.803
You sure did, you was
rough on that boy. I felt so bad.

639
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.370
See, your daddy was raw.

640
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.216
He'd beat the hell out you
and leave you out in the street,

641
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.810
just bloody guts all over, everywhere.

642
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.484
I at least would
take you to the hospital

643
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.925
after I knocked the hell out you.

644
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.840
Look, son, just go on up them
stairs, and do what I had to do to you

645
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.884
that day that you got mad at me.
Just go on, do what you gotta do, son.

646
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.291
Bite the bullet.

647
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.729
I am not taking my daughter on the roof
and throwing her off.

648
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.484
Why wouldn't you do that?

649
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.688
- He did that?
- Yes!

650
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.762
He sure did.

651
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.046
I'ma just tell you somethin',

652
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.256
if you're gonna try
and teach a child a lesson

653
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.806
and push 'em off a roof,
at least check they pockets.

654
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.530
Joe, you should have
checked his pockets.

655
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.650
I forgot about that little pencil. Oh.
Number two, yellow stick.

656
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.563
He had his little pencil
in his pocket...

657
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.016
Little pencil went straight through

658
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.122
one of his little balls.

659
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.561
Looked like a little
Tootsie Roll on a stick.

660
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.926
That poor thing.

661
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.808
I was traumatized.

662
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.851
Let me ask you somethin'.
Did you die?

663
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.724
That's not funny.
That's not funny.

664
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.849
I bet that's just
so interesting to see.

665
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.241
I just wanna look at it.

666
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.085
I bet you have problems
peein' too, don't you?

667
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.367
You probably just have one drop.

668
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.123
Plop.

669
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.207
Bam, hush that.

670
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.085
Oh... Oh...
Did it grow back?

671
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.685
Grow back?

672
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.762
I'm... I'm not a reptile, it doesn't...

673
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.684
Well, he just told us
he ain't no anaconda.

674
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.761
Though I almost felt bad when I saw
that little number two yellow pencil.

675
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.808
He almost got lead poisoning.

676
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.456
Daddy, you shouldn't have
pushed me off that roof.

677
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.811
That's all I'm gonna say.

678
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.684
You shouldn't have
pushed me off that roof.

679
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.368
Again. Did you die, nigga?

680
00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.205
How many times I have to tell you?
Stop using that word.

681
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.328
That is a horrible word.

682
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.210
I don't even understand
why you keep using that word.

683
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.328
Stop saying it, it's horrible!

684
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.721
It's awful. All these people
use it in the music...

685
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.136
All these kids
are in these clubs saying it.

686
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.162
Stop saying that word!

687
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.680
<i>Bitch ass.</i>

688
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.808
Daddy, I'm warning you. Stop that...

689
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.848
- Nigga.
- Okay, let's get this clear.

690
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.241
Nobody is laying a hand
on my daughter, okay?

691
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.086
Now, Madea, can you please not tell her
that I asked you to come by?

692
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.969
Okay, can you please
just tell her that...

693
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.081
Um...

694
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.721
You were in the neighborhood,
and... And you stopped by.

695
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.245
Okay? Can you do that?

696
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.376
Yeah, he wants me to lie.
I'm not gonna lie.

697
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.961
- I don't do that. I'm not a liar.
- Why? You scared of her?

698
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.929
No, I'm not scared of her, but I just...

699
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.082
I'm trying this approach
that I read in a book,

700
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.401
that you and your kids should be...

701
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.960
Buddies. Pals.
You should be friends.

702
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.042
Friends? You ain't
supposed to be friends

703
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.770
with your damn child, you the parent.

704
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.171
Y'all not equals.

705
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.527
What the hell you talkin' 'bout,
a friend? A friend?

706
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.816
They have to listen to
what the hell you tell them to do.

707
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.096
If they don't, they gotta
bounce they <i>ass</i> up out the house.

708
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.441
Go pay they own mortgage.
Go pay they own rent.

709
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.363
Go pay something, do you understand?

710
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.601
Being a damn child friend.

711
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.896
What the hell is wrong with you,
talkin' 'bout being your child friend.

712
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.809
- That's stupid as hell!
- I hear you, okay?

713
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.406
- Dad, you haven't left yet?
- Um...

714
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.804
- Hi.
- Hi.

715
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.136
Remember what I said to you.

716
00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.366
That you stopped by.

717
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.963
- What?
- Ms. Madea, how are you?

718
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.896
Oh, I'm fine, how you doin', baby?
Good to see you.

719
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.160
Good to see you, too.

720
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.480
Who the hell is that?

721
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.921
Mabel! That's the pastor's daughter.

722
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.764
Damn, you don't know that?

723
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.456
Hell, even I know that
and I don't even go to church.

724
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.096
You don't know that's
the pastor's daughter? Damn.

725
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.963
Sinner! Devil.

726
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.530
You know I don't know no pastor.

727
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.136
She rolled up on me
like she know me, like...

728
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.656
"Hey, how you doing?"
I don't know her like that.

729
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.016
Mabel, everybody know you, honey.

730
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.565
You been on the news so much.

731
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.325
Barn, you ain't gotta
tell people all my business.

732
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.925
Um, so, what are they doing here?

733
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.491
- I have no idea.
- Oh.

734
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.005
I just opened the door,

735
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.605
- and barn! There was Madea.
- Really?

736
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.761
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh.

737
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.656
I opened the door, she said,
"Happy Haller-ween."

738
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.256
You know how she says "haller"
and everything, so...

739
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.170
Madea, what are you doing here?

740
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.416
What the hell you mean
"what bring you by?" You called me.

741
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.842
Oh. Oh. Um...

742
00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.160
I was in...

743
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.526
The neigh...

744
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.206
The neighborhood, and...

745
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.965
I came... I was on my way to walk...

746
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.283
I was in the neighborhood and I came by
to talk to your... Oh.

747
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.362
To spend the... To stay the night.

748
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.284
Oh, I was in the neighborhood,
I came by to stay the night, yeah.

749
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.442
- That's too much to remember.
- Dad.

750
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.205
What? I didn't...
I didn't know. I had no idea.

751
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.169
I had no idea she was coming.

752
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.969
- But isn't it great?
- No!

753
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.376
Now you have somebody
to be here with you all night.

754
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.926
- That's great.
- Happy Haller-ween.

755
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.082
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thank you.

756
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.891
Listen, thank you for
having us over here, Brian.

757
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.176
- Okay?
- I'll see you later.

758
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.964
Hey, where the hell the liquor at?

759
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.008
I was so worried at my house.

760
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.970
You know, I'm scared of everything.
Scared of everything.

761
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.281
And this Halloween stuff
just give me the creeps.

762
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.408
She don't like...
She don't like Haller-ween.

763
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.970
Mmm-mmm. Don't like it at all.

764
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.776
It just give me the creeps.
But now I'm all right.

765
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.056
- 'Cause we all here together.
- All here together.

766
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.809
- That's right.
- Together.

767
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.296
Okay, well, I'm tired of talking
to you old people,

768
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.004
so I'm gonna go upstairs.

769
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.207
Nice to meet you!

770
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.416
There's something inside me
that want to go grab that girl

771
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.966
and slap the shit out of her.
But I'm not gonna do it.

772
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.844
Oh, it's getting late.

773
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.843
We gotta hurry if we're gonna
catch this party.

774
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.565
This makes me so mad.

775
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.082
I can't believe my dad got all these
old people here to watch me.

776
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.730
Oh, it's not that bad.

777
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.041
You know, Ms. Barn
kinda reminds me of my grandma.

778
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.202
She always gets
really scared on Halloween.

779
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.487
Starts talkin' 'bout
the devil and what not.

780
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.085
But then she just goes to sleep early.

781
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.924
She just wants the day to be over with.

782
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.522
Wait, no, that's it.

783
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.967
We're gonna trick them
into going to bed early.

784
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.441
Trick them?
What do you mean, trick them?

785
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.364
We're gonna scare the hell out of 'em.
Okay, listen, Aday.

786
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.522
When I tell you to press this,
you press it, 'kay?

787
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.651
Is this a bomb or something?

788
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.609
No, it's not a bomb,
it controls the lights.

789
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.250
- Oh, thank God.
- Come on.

790
00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.016
I thought we were blowing
old people up today.

791
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.041
No.

792
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.720
I'm tryin' to make it
to heaven, Tiffany.

793
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.568
They got a nice wood-burning fire.

794
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.207
Yeah, people don't have no
wood-burning fireplaces no more.

795
00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.282
Everything's gas now, these children.

796
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.091
We done got gas on everything.

797
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.003
- Did good.
- Hey.

798
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.242
Look what I brought home from school.

799
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.124
What... What the hell is that?

800
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.009
It's a ghost board, Grandpa.

801
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.242
Get that... Get that
on the hell on out of here.

802
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.481
No, ma'am. Uh-uh.

803
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.656
Get that devilment out of here.

804
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.681
Right.

805
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.082
No, it's fun.
It's how you communicate with the dead.

806
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.256
You heard her.
Get it on out of here, honey.

807
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.726
We don't play with stuff like that.
Get that up out of here.

808
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.211
No, it's fun!

809
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.090
I'ma tell you right now, if you open it,
that's what you're gonna be.

810
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.696
Dead. You're gonna be
on the other side.

811
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.056
We not playing with stuff
like that, honey.

812
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.480
We don't play with stuff like that.
Give me... Put this down.

813
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.416
What is that that fell out of the thing?

814
00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.976
What is that? I don't touch this stuff.

815
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.080
I grew up in New Orleans,
they got voodoo everywhere.

816
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.167
No.

817
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.801
It's a card. It says, "Death."

818
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.449
Oh, no.

819
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.488
Ain't no "oh, no."
I'ma tell you right now.

820
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.736
See, y'all children
don't understand.

821
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.256
Let me make this
perfectly clear to you, honey.

822
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.406
You don't be playing around.

823
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.696
Keep playing with the devil,
he gonna show up.

824
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.610
Yeah, he gonna show up. He's sittin'
right there in front of you.

825
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.400
I tell you right now,
don't play with me, little girl.

826
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.496
That's what you gonna look like,

827
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.648
just like that damn skeleton
on that card.

828
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.603
Doin' a pirouette.
You understand? Go to bed.

829
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.128
You don't understand.
This card comes from Mr. Wilson.

830
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.727
The man that died
in this house on Halloween.

831
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.771
He killed his entire family and put
all of their bodies in the attic.

832
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:35.007
And it's said that every Halloween
he comes back to take a life.

833
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.402
And the only place he doesn't go
in this house are the bedrooms.

834
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.642
Because that's where
the priests used to sleep

835
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.404
when this house was a monastery.

836
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.244
- Whoa.
- I know.

837
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.609
So we should all go to sleep.
It's safer there, anyways.

838
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.365
The ghosts come out at midnight.

839
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.171
Okay. Time for me to go.

840
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.736
- Barn.
- I gotta get out of here.

841
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.524
Bam, hold the hell on.

842
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.090
- Barn.
- What?

843
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.491
What the hell's wrong with you?

844
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.409
Mabel, did you hear what she just said?

845
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.641
- Barn.
- What?

846
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.324
You forgot your canes.

847
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.765
- On!
- On!

848
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.765
Joe!

849
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.241
But ain't God good?
I don't even need my canes, Mabel.

850
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.691
- Sit down!
- Mabel.

851
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.976
Hell, we been helpin' you for days,

852
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.416
and you sittin' there actin' like
somethin' wrong with you.

853
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.776
Ain't nothing wrong with you. Sit down!

854
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.801
Yes.

855
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.376
This girl ain't doin'
nothin' but sitting here lyin'.

856
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.243
No, I'm not.
I'm telling the truth!

857
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.576
Girl, if you don't get up out
of here with that devilment,

858
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.080
I mean, you better get to steppin'.

859
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.844
I'm telling you. I'm going to bed.

860
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.407
'Cause after 10:00, strange things
start happening in this house.

861
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.165
Strange things.

862
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.616
No. I ain't gonna even be
able to do this.

863
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.803
I can't I got...
That's gonna blow my high.

864
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.486
High... You smoke marijuana?

865
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.080
I got a prescription!

866
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.606
You, little girl,
stay in a child's place.

867
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.331
Mabel, I gotta get outta here.
I'm scared, and I gotta

868
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.176
- get outta here, now!
- Calm down, Bam. Bam!

869
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.565
Calm the hell down.

870
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.244
This girl is lyin'.

871
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.681
I'm gonna go to bed.
Don't let the ghosts get you.

872
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.125
Be on outta here.

873
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.971
She lyin'. Hold on!

874
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.921
What? Oh.

875
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.760
I'ma fuck you up!

876
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.890
What the hell was that?

877
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.325
I'm sorry.

878
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.736
What happened to the lights?

879
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.569
Help me, Jesus.

880
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.165
That was Mr. Wilson.

881
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.336
Girl, get out of here.
You ain't doin' nothin' but lyin'.

882
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.885
Hell, that was just...
That was just...

883
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.456
That was just...
That was just power...

884
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.689
Power... P... That was just...
That was just the power acting up.

885
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.489
- Okay, well, goodnight.
- Go to bed!

886
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.776
Go to bed, girl, hell.

887
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.211
All right.

888
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.203
Sittin' there tellin' all them lies.

889
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.810
- Come on, Aday.
- I'm scared.

890
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.882
- Come on!
- Okay, okay.

891
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.323
Dea, Dea, I'm scared.

892
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.368
- Me too.
- Bam, calm the hell down.

893
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.487
Calm the hell down.

894
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.526
- Tiffany, come on!
- It's time to go.

895
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.682
Shh! Don't wake the old people!

896
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.526
Okay, gonna fix the bed.

897
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.616
- Fix the bed. Pull this down.
- What are we doing to the bed?

898
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.256
We're gonna make it look like
we're sleeping in here.

899
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.930
Oh.

900
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.969
- Like a body?
- Yeah, like a body.

901
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.201
Okay.

902
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.563
Wait, over there. Here. Okay.

903
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.244
That looks like you been eatin' good.

904
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.800
Wait, hold on.

905
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.530
Okay. Let's sneak down the back stairs.

906
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.887
- Oh, I don't know about this.
- Come on.

907
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.044
- Close the door.
- Okay.

908
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.921
Good Lord.

909
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.881
Hmm.

910
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.522
This damn girl has snuck up
out of this damn house!

911
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.250
Bam, y'all ain't gonna believe this.

912
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.696
Y'all ain't gonna believe this at all.

913
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.085
What that, Ma?

914
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.656
That girl has snuck up
out of this house.

915
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.681
- Uh-uh.
- No!

916
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.564
Yes, she did.

917
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.005
Well, where's she going to?

918
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.536
Probably over there to that frat party.

919
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.800
I knew it.

920
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.566
You talkin' 'bout over there where
all them fine, sexy college men's be?

921
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.051
Hattie...

922
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.645
Let's ride.

923
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.926
Come on, Joe.

924
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.571
No, you go on, I'm gonna stay here
and pray for her safe return.

925
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.529
Hey, hey. Hey, come here, come here.

926
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.409
- Joe, what is it?
- Come here.

927
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.811
- Come here.
- What is it?

928
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.767
- Let me hold one of them...
- Joe.

929
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.376
Why you gotta be all stingy
'cause you legal, baby?

930
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.401
Come on, help me out.

931
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.962
Joe, I got a prescription for this here.
I don't have any for you.

932
00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.481
The Lord gonna bless you, you share.

933
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.801
You make me so sick!

934
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.321
Here, Joe. This... You owe me.

935
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.041
All right. When you come back,
I'll tap that ass for you.

936
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.089
In that case, you gonna be payin' me.

937
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.770
Is it like that?

938
00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.723
Go ahead on, then. I'll be here,
waitin' for y'all to get back.

939
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.362
Prayin' for her safe return.
That the Lord will bless her.

940
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.885
Hey, I need a lighter!

941
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.324
Wait, Mabel, stop it!

942
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.084
I know, I know, damn well...

943
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.764
Let's get out of the car here.

944
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.656
You didn't have to be
jacking my neck like that.

945
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.967
Damn! What, it backfired.

946
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.644
You know my brakes is bad, Hattie.

947
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.245
Hey, what the hell does that mean?

948
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.926
Uh... Lord, have mercy.
Look at these children.

949
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.480
Hurry up, Bam, get out the car.

950
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.689
Look at this.
Look at this.

951
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.764
Look at all these fine,
sexy college men in here.

952
00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.002
Girl, leave...
Hattie, leave them children alone.

953
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.209
What, Ma? You know I don't mind buying
two or three college books for these...

954
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.776
Well, somebody gonna throw
a damn book at you.

955
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.976
Leave these little boys alone.

956
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.096
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

957
00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.770
What the hell is that?

958
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.569
It's my costume, I'm Peter Pan.

959
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.880
Duh!

960
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.530
She said she pissed her pants!

961
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.921
You know she said
she pissed her pants!

962
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.525
I didn't piss in my pants!

963
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.016
Don't do that
in front of these children!

964
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.376
- Get on in the house.
- I said I'm Peter Pan!

965
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.016
Go on up in there
and help me find this girl.

966
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.371
All this foolishness.

967
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.886
Yo-ho-yo-yo-yo-yo!
Sick costume, bro!

968
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.406
What? What is wrong with you?

969
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.050
Dude.

970
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.406
- Whoa!
- Boy, what the hell?

971
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.922
Put your hand on my damn breast again.

972
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.764
I just wanted to say
it looked real!

973
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.968
Like, saggy and lumpy...

974
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.087
But real.

975
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.810
Hey, let me see 'em.

976
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.120
Say What?

977
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.726
- Show us your boobs, please?
- You got some beads or something?

978
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.736
You gonna put some dollar bills
up in these breasts?

979
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.967
- No, we just wanna see 'em.
- We just like boobs.

980
00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.849
- What? You wanna see 'em.
- Yeah!

981
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.331
Boobs! Let's see boobs.

982
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.776
- You wanna see 'em?
- Yeah, twin peaks.

983
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.165
You wanna see 'em?

984
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.851
- Yes.
- Wait.

985
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.843
Yes. Behold, paradise.

986
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.566
Right before your eyes.

987
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.961
How'd you get it to look like
real skin though, man?

988
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.136
Touch 'em.
Touch 'em. Touch 'em.

989
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.446
Look at those veins.

990
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.216
- Nipples and everything.
- Such intricate...

991
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.446
See how warm?

992
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.856
How'd you get the veins to look...

993
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.882
- See how warm?
- And they're wrinkly.

994
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.246
See how warm?

995
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.970
- I think this is real.
- Oh, no, no, no.

996
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.496
- No, those are real.
- Like saggy sandbags.

997
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.576
I think I'm gonna be sick.

998
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.776
- I need a drink.
- Oh, my God.

999
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.690
Move, move, move! Oh, my God.

1000
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.570
Grabbin' on me, hell,
I used to get dollar bills for that!

1001
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.449
I'll make it rain up in this piece.

1002
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.016
Barn, Hattie, y'all wait for me.
Get the hell on out the damn way.

1003
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.964
Damn chicken! And a banana.

1004
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.936
What the hell, you waitin'?
You wanna see this ass?

1005
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.645
Come here, I'm gonna show you this ass!
Come see it!

1006
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.768
Come on back here!
Where the hell they run to?

1007
00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.161
Hattie, Bam, where y'all at?

1008
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.925
Mabel! It's a lot to look at in here.

1009
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.968
It sure the hell is, it sure is.

1010
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.883
- Damn!
- Excuse me, miss...

1011
00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.041
Mabel!

1012
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.964
This here is a costume party.

1013
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.690
I don't know
if that was a costume, hell.

1014
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.445
We gonna have to look up under
every one of 'em till we find 'em.

1015
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.847
Okay, great, I don't mind doing that.

1016
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.967
Hattie, Hattie. Under the face!

1017
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.530
Up under the face!

1018
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.762
You ain't gonna find her up
under his pants.

1019
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.571
You don't know what
she come as! She could be...

1020
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.246
She at a costume party,
she could have come as anything!

1021
00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.641
Wait a minute.

1022
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.251
Yeah, there it is. Mabel,
I'm gonna look upstairs.

1023
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.800
Bam, look around down here.

1024
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.736
Hattie, you go on up there
'cause you can handle it.

1025
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.171
This girl, she still fiendin'.

1026
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.536
And I'm gonna go
and look around down here.

1027
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.656
- Go on and look around.
- Okay, Ma.

1028
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.966
<i>'</i>- <i>I</i> got...

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.568

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.644
Yeah, some of y'all need

Do your mama know
you're dressing like this?

1036
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.725
She picked out my outfit.

1037
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.609
Your mama picked out your outfit?

1038
00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.045
- Duh.

Uh... No. We don't.

1043
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.166
Who's looking for her?

1044
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.376
Who looking for her? I'm her aunt,
and I'm looking for her.

I know she up in here somewhere.

Yeah, she's right over there.

Oh, no.

Shouldn't we stay together?
Don't make me go with him.

1058
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.616
I mean, if y'all get

1059
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.130
- Have fun!
- Take your costumes off.

1060
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.680
Take your costumes off, too.
They won't recognize you that way.

1061
00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.041
Lord, y'all little skinny asses...
Get out the way, hell.

Are you on that shit? Calm down.

1066
00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.056
Hey, listen, son, do you know a Tiffany?
I'm looking for Tiffany.

1067
00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.491
- Oh, Tiffany.
- Yes.

1068
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.696
- Oh, about this tall?
- Right.

1069
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.801
- Black hair?
- Yes.

1070
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.723
I've never seen her!

1071
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.529
Hey, got milk?

1072
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.849
- Yo, chill!
- Do it again.

1073
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.400
I ain't got no damn milk,
but I got some bullets.

1074
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.131
Ma'am, ma'am, I didn't know
it was like that. Chill.

1075
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.571
You're telling me this is a lady?

1076
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.610
Yes! And she's looking
for someone named Tiffany,

1077
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.205
but we've never seen a Tiffany.

1078
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.721
No, no, we haven't.

1079
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.761
Yo, yo, everybody, listen up!
Listen up. Chaz, what's up, man?

1080
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.491
How you doin'? Yo, announcement.

1081
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.600
Big announcement. It's time for
the special guest of the evening.

1082
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.087
Give it up for Tyga!

1083
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.928
We about to get turnt up!
Let's see everybody hands up like this!

1084
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.686
- Son.
- What?

1085
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.761
- Hands up.
- Son.

1086
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.162
We can't hear you!

1087
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.400
Oh, yeah!

1088
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.404
Turn this music...
Turn this noise...

1089
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.961
Mabel, did you find her?

1090
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.845
Barn, you been drinkin'?
No, I didn't find her.

1091
00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.764
And they got this rap...
I can't stand this music.

1092
00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.561
But, Mabel, if you can't stand it,
why your body...

1093
00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.484
Why your body moving like that?

1094
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.530
That's that ho, that's my bottom half.

1095
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.046
Every time it hear this music,
it just wanna drop.

1096
00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.296
That's the ho from back in the day

1097
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.731
- coming out of me.
- Yeah.

1098
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.136
I don't like this rap.

1099
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.288
I don't like this.
I don't, I don't like this.

1100
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.841
Mabel!

1101
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.081
I get to get the hell outta here.
My ho coming out.

1102
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.650
Go, granny on the mic!

1103

<i>♪ Hey, put your hands up!

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.776
- Wait a minute.
- Hold the hell on.

1111
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.805
I just unplugged the damn music.
And I'ma tell you right now.

1112
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.805
Let me make this very, very, perfectly
clear to all of y'all up in here.

1113
00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.281
I have been nice,
and I have been lookin' for Tiffany.

1114
00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.811
Y'all better present Tiffany.

1115
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.011
You got 32.1 of a second
to present her to me right now.

1116
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.651
I don't give a damn if Tyga upset here.

1117
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.376
- I don't give a damn...
- Okay. That's it!

1118
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.080
- That is it!
- Get her out!

1119
00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.724
Get her outta here!

1120
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.086
I said get her out of here!

1121
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.128
Wait! Wait!

1122
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.001
Bring that beat back!

1123
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.003
<i>Throw her old ass out!</i>

1124
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.840
Barn, what the hell's
wrong with you?

1125
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.361
Come on, let's go to the damn house.

1126
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.326
All right. She's gone.
Will she call the police?

1127
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.007
No. She's got lots of warrants.
She's crazy but she's not that crazy.

1128
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.368
Look, Tiff, we love you and Aday, but...

1129
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.329
We just don't like the drama.

1130
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.051
Well, I'm sorry that my dad is so lame.

1131
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.407
Well, we just can't hang out
and have this happen again.

1132
00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.881
Well, it won't happen again.
I promise.

1133
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.327
This is why we said that,
you know, you shouldn't come.

1134
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.323
It's 'cause your dad's
gonna flip, dude.

1135
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.136
And, you know, now Jonathan is missing
his party, it's kind of unfair.

1136
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.207
Yeah.

1137
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.203
Well, don't worry about Jonathan.

1138
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.327
I'll make it up to him.

1139
00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.890
- Oh. All right.
- Okay.

1140
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.042
- Mmm-hmm. Okay. All right.
- Have fun.

1141
00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.167
Bye.

1142
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.289
Listen, I'm so sorry about all of this.

1143
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.442
Yo, Tiffany, it's all good,

1144
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.727
but are you sure she's not
gonna call the police?

1145
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.088
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm surprised
they even left the house.

1146
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.687
I was telling them this story
about how the house is haunted.

1147
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.136
Oh, you should have
seen their eyes.

1148
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.527
They were, like, scared.

1149
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.365
- Really?
- Yes.

1150
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.205
Oh! All right. Tell me more.

1151
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.883
Oh, Lord.
I think I want to go home.

1152
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.849
Yeah, me too. Home run.

1153
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.242
Knock you out the park.
I'm talking fifth base.

1154
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.800
Is there even a fifth base?
What is that?

1155
00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.882
What are you freaking out for?
Come on.

1156
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.803
I'm not. What do you mean?

1157
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.042
We'll get weird on each other.
What do you say?

1158
00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.929
I'm just 17.

1159
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:14.161
- You're 17?
- Yes.

1160
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.129
Years old?

1161
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.964
- Yeah.
- In human years.

1162
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.521
Yes.

1163
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.970
This girl is 17!
Seventeen years old!

1164
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.448
I'm mad as hell.
I'm mad as hell!

1165
00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.046
Gonna throw me down in them bushes,
and Bam, you sitting there,

1166
00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.536
sitting there getting' high
with them damn boys.

1167
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.856
And Barn, you wasn't even
gonna help me?

1168
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.850
You supposed to be fightin' for me.
Y'all was supposed to have my back. Oh!

1169
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.081
Mabel, I got your back.

1170
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.004
I always have, always had your back,
but I'm high, Mabel.

1171
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.856
Somebody needs to call the police,
that's all I know.

1172
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.291
Somebody need to call the po-po.

1173
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.056
You so damn worried about her,
you call 'em.

1174
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.445
Hell, I'm trying to sleep.

1175
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.016
Oh, no, I can't do that, I got warrants.

1176
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.409
- Mabel, call them anonymously.
- That's what got me in trouble!

1177
00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.416
Because anonymously is how
I was writing them checks

1178
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.205
and dealing with them
credit card frauds. I can't do that.

1179
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.416
Somebody else got to call 'em.

1180
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.843
I can't call them neither, Ma.
They know my voice, too.

1181
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.456
Well, you know damn well
they know mine.

1182
00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.006
Ma, why don't you just go
describe your voice?

1183
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.481
- Do what?
- Describe your voice.

1184
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.050
The word is not "describe," honey.

1185
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.256
If I describe my voice
then they gonna know it's me talkin'.

1186
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.250
It is "disguise."
And I can't disguise my voice.

1187
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.209
Because they have voice
data recognition.

1188
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.521
I'm on the terrorist list, too.
I'm on terrorist watch.

1189
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.931
They recognize it.

1190
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.203
I'll call 'em, hell.

1191
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.971
How much damn stuff
you got up in them breasts?

1192
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.169
I bet you take all that stuff
out and breasts is just flat.

1193
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.607
Barn, you high,
what you gonna say before you call 'em?

1194
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.480
Uh... Yeah!

1195
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.616
Wait a minute, hell,
you gonna call 'em like Lil Jon?

1196
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.722
No, I'm gonna call 'em
like a little white girl.

1197
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.524
Oh. You a little white girl?

1198
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.682
Barn, you ain't never been
little in your life.

1199
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.007
And she never been white, either.

1200
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.250
What you gonna say when you call 'em?

1201
00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.245
Yeah, listen, we need the police.

1202
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:07.326
I'm being held against my will.
Help me! Help me!

1203
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.091
Ma, it's something wrong with her.

1204
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.003
Really, really wrong.

1205
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.845
Barn. Listen to me, honey,
make this perfectly clear.

1206
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.491
Just call the people and tell them...
Listen to me.

1207
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.244
Just tell them that an underage girl

1208
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.920
snuck out the house and she at
a frat party. Don't do all of that.

1209
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.962
Okay, Mabel.

1210
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.929
- Yo, stop, stop!
- Pull the rip cord, bro!

1211
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.731
- What the hell, don't you knock?
- Look, somethings wrong with Aday,

1212
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.536
- she just ran out of here.
- Where did she go?

1213
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.006
- I don't know!
- Well, what happened?

1214
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.606
I told her to get the hell out.
She's 17.

1215
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.564
And so is this broad fraud right here.

1216
00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.603
Are you crazy?
We could all go to jail!

1217
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.242
Hold up, she's not 17.
Does this look like a 17-year-old?

1218
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.964
Are you 17?

1219
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.090
- Yes.
- Oh!

1220
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.605
Tiffany, that's just...

1221
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.808
- Tiffany, that's just wrong!
- I know. I'm sorry.

1222
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.167
No! We can all get kicked out
of school for this.

1223
00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.402
- I'm sorry!
- Wait, how old are you guys?

1224
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.527
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

1225
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.886
Cool, cool.

1226
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.128
All right, all right,
I need all the illegals

1227
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.123
to get out of this frat right now.

1228
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.123
- Go. There's the door.
- Guys.

1229
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.656
The cops are here.

1230
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.091
All right. All right, listen.

1231
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.970
Everybody out. Take her out
the back door and try to find Aday.

1232
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.168
- Come on, Tiff.
- Outta here. Let's go, go, go.

1233
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.280
Out of my way, peasants!
I ain't going back. Go, go!

1234
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.089
What's up, Officer?
My name is Jonathan.

1235
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.242
The <i>El</i> Presidente
of this here fraterni-tay.

1236
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.970
How can I help you?

1237
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.088
Party's over.
Everyone clear out of the house.

1238
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.128
- Present IDs. Now.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1239
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.929
You got a warrant, hot shot?

1240
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.136
You want me to call the dean
and wake her up?

1241
00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.605
No, no.

1242
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.360
That's what I thought.
Everyone, clear out!

1243
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.640
Party's over, now.

1244
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.563
All right. Everyone out!

1245
00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.325
- Party's over.
- Lamest party ever.

1246
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.605
What a bummer.

1247
00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.729
Officer Buzzkill over here, man.

1248
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.047
Did that really just happen?

1249
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.124
- Man, it was lit.
- You really leaving?

1250
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.568
I don't play with po-po.
We out, homie. All right.

1251
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.530
Tyga, no.Tyga.

1252
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.600
This sucks.

1253
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.216
Hey, you know it was them geezers
that called the police. You know that.

1254
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.651
Oh, I know.

1255
00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.160
We can't let 'em get away with this.

1256
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.376
You know, it was our own fault,

1257
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.016
they shouldn't have been here
in the first place.

1258
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.246
Would you mind shutting up?

1259
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.845
This is not our fault and I refuse

1260
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.083
to let some old people
deny this frat's reputation.

1261
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.207
What are we gonna do?

1262
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.046
Oh, we're gonna get so even, fellas.
Here's the plan.

1263
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.724
Madea! Madea!

1264
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.482
- What the hell?
- Mabel!

1265
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.648
What's this? Lord, have mercy.

1266
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.722
Hattie, what the hell wrong with you?

1267
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.566
I think I heard somethin'
scratchin' up my wall.

1268
00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.210
Girl, go on with that, hell.

1269
00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.567
I think it's that man
that killed his whole family.

1270
00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.642
I think it's Mr. Wilson, Ma.

1271
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.484
Hattie, calm the hell down, ain't no...

1272
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.096
What the hell is that, now?
What the hell is that?

1273
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.121
Wait!

1274
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.407
It's him, Ma,
I ain't ready to die, Ma.

1275
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.289
Listen, listen, would you hush?

1276
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.456
Yes. Please, Hattie.
Ain't no ghosts in this house.

1277
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.136
Ain't no ghost gonna be
knocking on the damn door.

1278
00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.050
Does that make sense to you?
A ghost that damn knock on the door?

1279
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.407
That's crazy as hell!

1280
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.130
Bam, go open that door.

1281
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.130
I know you ain't sending me
to that door.

1282
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.201
Uh-uh.

1283
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.489
You scared, Mabel.

1284
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.329
I ain't scared of nothin'.

1285
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.370
Go open the door.
Go open the door, Mabel.

1286
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.604
I'm tired right now.
Uh, Joe, open the door.

1287
00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.336
Hell, I ain't going to that door,
this ain't my house.

1288
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.696
I ain't goin' nowhere near that door.

1289
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.360
Go on and get it, bruh.

1290
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.289
- What the hell?
- Oh, no.

1291
00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.283
- Hattie, what the hell is it?
- Oh, no, Ma.

1292
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.250
- What is it, Hattie?
- You see somethin' scary at the door?

1293
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.560
What is it?

1294
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.210
It's white men.

1295
00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.361
What?

1296
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.805
You see white people?

1297
00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.251
Girl, that's the po-po, here.

1298
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.482
- Hide the stuff!
- Get the stuff...

1299
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.562
Oh, hell, I ain't got nothing.

1300
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.444
We ain't got nothin' to hide.

1301
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.205
That took me back in the day when
the po-po used to come round here,

1302
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.169
and everybody would be
just duckin', runnin'.

1303
00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.480
Them was the good old days.

1304
00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.370
Oh, man, please.
I got a prescription, I'm good.

1305
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.816
Okay, well, Bam, go open the door.

1306
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.171
Why I gotta open the door?

1307
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.720
'Cause you got a prescription, you good.
Go open the door here.

1308
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.643
All right, all right.

1309
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.646
Hi. Urn, someone here
called for the cops?

1310
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.484
Uh...

1311
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.167
No speak-a English...
I'm from Jamaica.

1312
00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.323
- They speak English in Jamaica.
- Well, I'm from Mexico.

1313
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.483
- Como <i>esta usted?</i>
- Well, then, I'm from China.

1314
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.325
Hey, hallelujah!
You speak in tongues?

1315
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.882
- I went to college.
- And I love Jesus. Yes, I do, too.

1316
00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.883
- We all do, too.
- Yes.

1317
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.849
Look, we got a call
about an underage girl...

1318
00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.763
What they saying?
I can't hear 'em.

1319
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.205
What's that smell?

1320
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.760
- Oh!
- Bam!

1321
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.365
I been waitin' to do this for years!

1322
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.887
I'm legal! I'm legal, bruh!

1323
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.450
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Hallelujah.

1324
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.251
Yeah. That's what I said,
too, when I got it.

1325
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.810
Okay.

1326
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.841
I know damn well
this girl is not...

1327
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.644
Where the hell you been?

1328
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.371
I'm tellin' you right now,
I'm gonna... She...

1329
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.204
I'ma bust her in her face.

1330
00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.611
Excuse me, are you Tiffany?

1331
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.886
Yes.

1332
00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.405
Look, I get it, it's Halloween,

1333
00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.136
you guys are always
playing tricks on everybody.

1334
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.049
- Enough is enough.
- Okay.

1335
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.929
Enjoy your fun
and call it an evening.

1336
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.331
Okay.

1337
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.721
We can't keep on having
these prank calls. You understand?

1338
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.689
I understand.

1339
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.091
Yes, sir.

1340
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.401
Okay. Well, you two
have a good evening.

1341
00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.562
Sorry, Officer.
Say "Sorry, Officer!"

1342
00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.404
Sorry, Officer.

1343
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.887
Back to you.

1344
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.925
- They gone?
- Yeah.

1345
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.616
Call 'em back.
'Cause I'm getting' ready to get her.

1346
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.291
Why, well, hold on, Muggum, why?

1347
00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.521
Where the hell you been?

1348
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.376
- I been asleep.
- You have not been up there.

1349
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.856
I've been up them stairs looking
for you, you were not sleepin'.

1350
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.611
Well, did you check my dad's room?
Because that's where I was.

1351
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.456
Why would you be up in his room when
you supposed to be in your own room?

1352
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.563
Well, sometimes my room gets cold.
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

1353
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.091
You lyin'.

1354
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.856
Like I said, the closer
it gets to midnight,

1355
00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.326
the crazier things
are gonna get around here.

1356
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.449
And you know
Mr. Wilson is close when...

1357
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.967
That happens.

1358
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.249
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
back to bed. So...

1359
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.696
Come back here, honey.
Come back here.

1360
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.846
Come right back damn here.

1361
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.888
- Where is Aday?
- She's asleep.

1362
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.656
You are lying to me,
that girl is not up there.

1363
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.125
I'm not lying to you.

1364
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.216
I'm coming up them stairs and check
for her, I'm tellin' you right now.

1365
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.449
Okay, well, me and Aday
are gonna be in my dad's room.

1366
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.284
Mabel, this... What the hell.

1367
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.816
Now look here, I don't...
I don't do this.

1368
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.205
I don't do this demonizing.

1369
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.496
That's him! That's him.

1370
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.409
Girl, what the hell going on
with these lights?

1371
00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.084
It's Mr. Wilson!

1372
00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.767
Mr. Wilson,
please leave me alone, Mr. Wilson.

1373
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.049
It's gonna take a lot more than that
to get him to leave you alone.

1374
00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.646
And they say it gets cold when he's mad.

1375
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.848
Mabel, she better stop this, Mabel.

1376
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.844
She better stop this, I'm not playing.
She better stop this.

1377
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.896
Girl, get the hell on
out of here with all the bullshit.

1378
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.445
No, I'm telling the truth.
He's coming.

1379
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.568
And the only safe place is in the bed.

1380
00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.966
Well, it is kind of shitty in here.

1381
00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.321
What? You went and did what to yourself?

1382
00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.722
- I said it's shitty in here.
- What are you saying?

1383
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.689
It's shitty in here.

1384
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.536
She's saying "cold," honey.
She's saying it's...

1385
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.050
- Chilly.
- Chilly.

1386
00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.044
Lord, have mercy,
I don't know why the hell...

1387
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.736
Brian better hurry up
and get the hell back here,

1388
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.444
'cause, come on, sit down, here.

1389
00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.409
Mabel, will you please
come take me home?

1390
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.840
Just come on and sit down.

1391
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.736
Answer the phone, answer the phone.

1392
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.096
Answer the phone.

1393
00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.376
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1394
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.776
Aday, it's Tiffany,
I've been calling you,

1395
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.371
I've been texting you
for almost half an hour now.

1396
00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.649
I don't know what to do, where are you?
Please, please get back to me.

1397
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.165
Call me back, please.

1398
00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.481
Hattie! Turn the water off!

1399
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:15.767
Hattie.

1400
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.847
Hattie...

1401
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.684
Hattie, you got to start
turning the water off

1402
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.000
when you come in here.

1403
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:27.847
What the hell?

1404
00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.887
What the...

1405
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.007
Huh?

1406
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.401
Wait a minute.

1407
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.608
I know I turned this, I said turn off.

1408
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:58.440
What the hell is that? Get... Get...

1409
00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.760
What the hell?

1410
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.724
Mabel! What the hell is this?

1411
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.931
Get your fat... They talkin' to...

1412
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.722
Mabel! Madea! Madea!

1413
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.976
<i>And Halloween
is going to the dogs this year,</i>

1414
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.765
<i>at the annual Halloween
dog costume contest.</i>

1415
00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.922
<i>Dogs are hard at work,
trying to come up with</i> a...

1416
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:38.761
<i>Came dressed as fairies, dinosaurs,
superheroes, pirates, and royalty.</i>

1417
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.242
<i>But what really surprised the crowd
was a guest appearance...</i>

1418
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.726
<i>Even the dogs were
getting into the festivities,</i>

1419
00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.690
<i>doing a little trick-or-treating
of their own.</i>

1420
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.570
<i>But not all dogs
were enjoying the festivities.</i>

1421
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.645
<i>But overall, it was
a wonderful day had by all.</i>

1422
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.485
<i>In other news, two people
were killed when the driver of a...</i>

1423
01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.767
What the hell wrong with
this here remote control?

1424
01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.641
<i>Hattie... Hattie...</i>

1425
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.041
Oh, hell no,
now you gonna call my name?

1426
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.646
<i>Hattie.</i>

1427
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.001
Yes, Lord?

1428
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.287
<i>You don't need the Lord.</i>

1429
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.571
I know him.

1430
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.001
<i>It's not the Lord.</i>

1431
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.376
<i>We interrupt your
regularly scheduled programming</i>

1432
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.845
<i>to bring you this special notice.</i>

1433
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.002
<i>I'm Mr. Wilson.</i>

1434
01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.766
Mr. Wilson? Oh, hell no! Hell no!

1435
01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.326
Madea! Madea! Madea! Madea!

1436
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.211
Madea! Madea!

1437
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.096
Hattie, what the hell
is wrong with you?

1438
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.009
- Ma! Madea!
- Mabel!

1439
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.880
What the... What the hell
is wrong with y'all?

1440
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.561
Ma, I've seen something in my room.
My TV won't go off.

1441
01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.856
- What?
- I was in that bathroom

1442
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.360
- and the water wouldn't go off.
- Get up.

1443
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.176
Mabel, I'm not playing with you,
listen to me.

1444
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.736
I looked in the mirror, Mabel,
and there's something wrote,

1445
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.207
"Get your fat ass out of here. Or die."

1446
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.931
- Mabel, they're talking to me.
- Y'all believin' that girl?

1447
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.685
That ain't nothing but Joe
playing a trick on y'all.

1448
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.205
No, Joe's downstairs.

1449
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.726
He's still downstairs.
He's sitting in that chair.

1450
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.041
He's still sitting in that chair.

1451
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.761
- He's still... Yeah.
- Where he was before?

1452
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.525
Y'all go to bed.
Stop acting like y'all scared.

1453
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.256
Ma, don't try to act like
you ain't scared.

1454
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.681
- You scared, ain't you?
- I am not scared.

1455
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.296
- Mabel...
- Honey, I'm not scared.

1456
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.288
Mabel, why are you up here in this bed?

1457
01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.283
With your good running church shoes.

1458
01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.091
Mabel, you got every light on in here.

1459
01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.571
I was reading.

1460
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.641
Reading what?

1461
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.290
I was trying to read the Bible.

1462
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.250
- You weren't reading no Bible, Ma!
- Where is the Bible?

1463
01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.164
It's on the table in my heart.

1464
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.924
Mabel, we gotta get out of here.

1465
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.011
- Okay.
- I'm having a...

1466
01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.656
- Did that come from the attic?
- Yeah.

1467
01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.127
Did she say he was in the attic?
Get the hell on up out of here!

1468
01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.083
Y'all get the hell up out of here!

1469
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.246
Mabel.

1470
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.322
Y'all know I can't
run down these stairs.

1471
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.811
What the hell?

1472
01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.805
Now, Joe, stop playing games
on these old ladies up there!

1473
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.764
I ain't playing no damn jokes.
I'm playing with myself.

1474
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.656
Joe, I know it's you.
I know you're down here doin' it.

1475
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.126
Look, everybody out here out of breath.
Can't breathe at all.

1476
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.771
Bam tired running down the stairs.

1477
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.080
Damn, you out of shape.

1478
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.130
How the hell you get this out of breath
running down the stairs, Bam?

1479
01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.646
Now Joe, stop it.

1480
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.296
Now, y'all come on, we only got
a few more hours to be in this house.

1481
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.240
Now, come on, let's go on
up there and go to bed.

1482
01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.163
- Madea! You heard that, Ma?
- I heard hollering like a damn fool.

1483
01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.568
- Ma, I know you heard it upstairs.
- No, I didn't. I didn't hear nothing.

1484
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.689
Yes, you did, Ma. You know, they say
that's where he killed

1485
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.730
his whole entire family,
up in the attic.

1486
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.204
Joe, you see these ladies is worried.

1487
01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.216
Get up and be a man and go on up there
and check and see what's in the attic.

1488
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.366
Bitch, please.

1489
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.681
Mabel, come on, take me home.

1490
01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.167
Hey, I'll take all you hoes to a hotel,

1491
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.368
if you hoes don't tell.

1492
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.010
Shut the hell up!

1493
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.251
Ma, go on up there
and see what's going on.

1494
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.368
I'm gonna stay down here with Joe.

1495
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.044
Me too.

1496
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.360
I'm gonna go.

1497
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.924
- I ain't scared.
- Okay, great.

1498
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.047
I ain't never scared.

1499
01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.724
- You're not scared.
- I'm never scared.

1500
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.096
- Then go up there then.
- I'm going up there.

1501
01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.360
- You bad.
- I'm never scared.

1502
01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.283
- You bad.
- I'm bad. Who's bad?

1503
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.522
- I ain't scared of nothing!
- Okay, great.

1504
01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.443
The hell I got up here
making all this noise?

1505
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.364
Probably nothing but these pipes
rattling like they do in my house.

1506
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.124
I don't know what's going on up here.

1507
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.645
Okay, great. Bye, Mabel.

1508
01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.376
- I ain't scared. I'll be back.
- Okay, great.

1509
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.050
- Bye, Mabel.
- Okay, great.

1510
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.208
If she don't come back I just
want y'all to know, that's a dude.

1511
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.009
I wanna go home, Mabel.

1512
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.444
I ain't scared of nothing.

1513
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.645
I ain't scared of nothing.

1514
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.689
I ain't never been scared of nothing.
I've been big all my life.

1515
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.762
I had to be brave.

1516
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.687
All my life I had to fight.

1517
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.044
I ain't never thought
I'd have to fight in Brian's house.

1518
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.204
Ain't nobody up here.

1519
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.564
Nobody. Ain't nobody up here.
Hey, ain't nobody up here.

1520
01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.606
I don't see nothing.

1521
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.368
Yeah, ain't nothing up here.

1522
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.126
Got all these crazy-looking costumes
and everything, ain't nothing up here.

1523
01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.129
Damn clown was back there.

1524
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.329
I know the damn clown did not just
move from where it was.

1525
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.124
Madea, you think she's all right?

1526
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.170
Ain't nothing to worry about.

1527
01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.480
What? What?

1528
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.284
Oh, Jesus. Ma!

1529
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.010
Mabel, are you all right?

1530
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.696
I thought there were a herd of buffalo
coming down the damn stairs.

1531
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.520
- Shaking up the whole damn house.
- Dea, what happened?

1532
01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.444
We got to go to my house.
We got to get the hell up out of here.

1533
01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.681
I thought you'd never ask!

1534
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.127
- Yes. Yes. Let's go.
- Ma, let's ride!

1535
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.656
What the hell is wrong with you, Hattie?

1536
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.841
Uh-uh.

1537
01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.524
- Ah... Look!
- I don't see nothing!

1538
01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.726
I'm not gonna fall for that.

1539
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.245
There's a clown.

1540
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.685
You saw a clown?

1541
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.683
- Yes.
- What'd he look like?

1542
01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.004
Oh, a dirty-looking clown.
He's a crazy-looking clown!

1543
01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.208
I saw one upstairs in the attic, too.

1544
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.282
I'm looking at three damn clowns.

1545
01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.330
Put y'all three side by side,
you shaped like a one-oh-one.

1546
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.050
Get the hell on up out of here.

1547
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.361
Joe, I'm telling you there's
something in this house.

1548
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.283
I gotta get out of here.

1549
01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.522
We got to go.
We got to go.

1550
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.284
I don't see nothing. He gone.

1551
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.407
- Yeah.
- I know.

1552
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.164
Mabel!

1553
01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.616
I'm getting ready to choke
the hell out of her.

1554
01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.404
- I'm gonna punch her dead.
- Mabel.

1555
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.041
Hey, girl, I'm getting ready to clog
your esophagus. Shut up!

1556
01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.326
It moved!

1557
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.767
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It moved!

1558
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.649
Yeah, if something is behind me...

1559
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.324
- Mabel. Oh, Lord!
- I'm gonna...

1560
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.607
I'm telling you right now, girl...
There's some... What?

1561
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.682
Mabel, no! No, look!

1562
01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.491
What's that breathing?

1563
01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.087
It's a clown, Ma!

1564
01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.731
I don't like no clown.

1565
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.243
Run! Run!

1566
01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.846
Get the hell out the door!
Get the hell out the door!

1567
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.256
Mabel!

1568
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.805
Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!

1569
01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.805
Hell no! Hell no!
Hell no, girl! Hell no!

1570
01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.769
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

1571
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.536
Get in the car, Hattie!
Get in the car, Bam!

1572
01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.164
Come on, Bam!

1573
01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.696
Get in the car!
Get in my car! Get in the car!

1574
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.530
Open my door! Y'all know
I had hip surgery!

1575
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.125
Mabel, be careful!

1576
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.801
- Why we just sitting here?
- I forgot the keys, girl.

1577
01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.803
Ah! Hotwire it!

1578
01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.611
Barn, what kind of lady
do you think I am?

1579
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.643
I'm a lady, I don't know
how to hotwire a car.

1580
01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.441
Who the hell do you think I am,
some kind of common criminal?

1581
01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.643
Well, that's all you had to say,
I got you on that, Ma.

1582
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.530
- Me too, girl, you know I know how...
- Wait! Wait!

1583
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.604
Are we just gonna leave the girl
in the house with the clown?

1584
01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.736
Listen, let me tell you
right now, that's Joe's grandchild.

1585
01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.016
I ain't got nothing to do with her.

1586
01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.405
She already got a nasty attitude,

1587
01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.562
it's every clown for himself.
Hotwire this.

1588
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.285
Oh, Joe, don't do that!

1589
01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.761
The hell?
Joe, what the hell is wrong with you?

1590
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.046
<i>Hey.</i>

1591
01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.056
The hell is wrong with you? I was about
to bust your face with this damn gun.

1592
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.536
I don't know where the hell
you think you're going.

1593
01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.609
You left these in the house. You left
your purse and everything up in there.

1594
01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.330
- Here.
- Give me my keys.

1595
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.607
Where are you going without them?

1596
01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.240
- I don't know.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1597
01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.216
And this phone of yours
been ringing off the hook.

1598
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.810
- Hello?
- I was up in there...

1599
01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.376
Burning up your minutes
and somebody's on the phone.

1600
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.856
<i>- Is anybody there?
- Who is it on the phone?</i>

1601
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.168
It's some preacher on the phone
working on my nerve!

1602
01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.164
Hell! Preacher. Pray for that.

1603
01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.730
- Here.
- What?

1604
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.848
Leave me the hell alone.
I'm going to lay down.

1605
01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.529
- Who is this?
- Don't answer that, Ma!

1606
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.376
Mabel, don't answer that.
I saw it in a movie.

1607
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.856
When you answer that thing,
the little girl...

1608
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.803
When she answered the phone,
she got dead.

1609
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.565
I remember that.
She said "Hello" and that thing said,

1610
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.324
"Are you in the house alone?"

1611
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.368
- I remember that.
- Yes.

1612
01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.885
Don't answer.

1613
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.291
It's all right.

1614
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.400
- Don't answer it!
- Don't.

1615
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.576
- Don't answer it.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1616
01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.840
But I hear somebody.

1617
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.096
<i>- Is anybody there?
- You say there's somebody...</i>

1618
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.485
Who is it?
Who the hell is it?

1619
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.449
<i>- This is Reverend Walker.
- Hey, Reverend.</i>

1620
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.602
- Hello, Madea.
- Reverend, look here.

1621
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.056
If you calling to pray for me,
I ain't got no time for that right now.

1622
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.606
- Well, a little prayer would be good.
- Bam, hush.

1623
01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.205
Okay, go and pray, Rev, go and pray.

1624
01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.850
<i>- Oh, Lord.
- Praise Jesus!</i>

1625
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.365
<i>Help us all to find peace!</i>

1626
01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.283
I'm gonna make him pray harder,
watch this.

1627
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.646
Hallelujah!

1628
01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.881
<i>Hallelujah! Wool!</i>

1629
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.803
He prayed harder.

1630
01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.291
<i>Come bring your...</i>

1631
01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.776
Look he started...
He started prayin' hard.

1632
01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.723
What is it, Reverend?
All right, enough.

1633
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.245
Amen, Jesus wept. What is it?

1634
01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.481
<i>Have you seen Aday?</i>

1635
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.244
No, she's up in the house with...

1636
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.970
- No, she's not. No.
- She's not?

1637
01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.883
- I know you lying to me.
- No, I'm not.

1638
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.616
Reverend, please don't
make me cuss on this phone.

1639
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.847
<i>- You need to come to the church.
- Okay, fine.</i>

1640
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.576
<i>- Come on down to the church.
- Thank you. Thank you.</i>

1641
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.656
- Madea. Now, Madea, <i>come on...</i>
- Well, what the Rev want?

1642
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.056
That girl snuck out of this house
and went down to that frat party.

1643
01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.321
That damn Tiffany done lied again!

1644
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.370
The Reverend want me to come over to
the church so he can talk to me.

1645
01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.760
That won't be a bad idea at all.

1646
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.496
A little prayer won't hurt
nobody right now.

1647
01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.016
Barn, I'm not going up
in there for no prayer.

1648
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.456
I'm going up in there
to set this straight.

1649
01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.767
This child, she gonna need
more than a little prayer.

1650
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.605
She gonna need the damn clown
and everything in there to help her

1651
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.016
when I get back here,
I'm telling you right now.

1652
01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.480
'Cause I'm not gonna deal with this.

1653
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.056
And Mr. Wilson and a clown, that's
gonna be the least of her worries.

1654
01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.402
Well, wait a minute, Ma, we just gonna
leave the girl up in there, right there?

1655
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.720
What the hell else we gonna do?

1656
01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.400
I'm not going
back up in there to get her.

1657
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.287
What the hell?

1658
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.410
Go on somewhere with that, clown.
Coming up here with that bullshit.

1659
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.005
Go on, clown, go on.

1660
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.536
Ain't nothing over there,
that's it, I'm telling you.

1661
01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.528
There ain't nobody in here with me.

1662
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.768
That's what I know.

1663
01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.446
Like that?

1664
01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.041
Yeah.

1665
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.850
I don't play that Halloween bullshit!

1666
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.447
Blowing my damn high,
coming up in here with a clown costume.

1667
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.409
I did that already tonight.

1668
01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.724
- Mabel!
- Yeah.

1669
01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.216
Got me going
out here to church, you know?

1670
01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.924
And that damn Aday
wasn't even up there.

1671
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.096
You wait till I get back home,
deal with that girl.

1672
01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.406
That's crazy <i>as</i> hell.

1673
01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.925
She is something else, Mabel.

1674
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.136
I'm gonna fix her though, she's...

1675
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.456
That clown gonna be the least of
her worries when I get back there.

1676
01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.216
Well, Mabel,

1677
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.811
and that's all right because
we gonna need a little prayer.

1678
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.576
What the hell?

1679
01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.125
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

1680
01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.096
- Mabel!
- Mabel! Jesus!

1681
01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.088
What the hell is wrong with it?

1682
01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.686
I don't know, I'm pressing the gas.

1683
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.603
Oh, now it's goin'...
Now it's goin' backwards.

1684
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.489
What in hell wrong with it?

1685
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.369
" Ma!
<i>'</i> Stop it!

1686
01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.680
What the hell is wrong with it?

1687
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.056
Put it in drive.

1688
01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.809
Baby, don't cut it off!

1689
01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.406
I didn't cut the damn car off,
it just killed, damn!

1690
01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.845
The hell is wrong with this thing?

1691
01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.690
Let me look up under the hood.

1692
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.696
I told you, I know Joe
did something to my damn car,

1693
01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.416
that's why I never let him
go borrow my car.

1694
01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.010
Ma, we gonna wait right here for you.

1695
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.004
Hattie, get your ass out of the car,
come help me. Bam, get out.

1696
01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.656
Mabel, I'm not getting
out of this car right now.

1697
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.176
It takes two people
to open this hood.

1698
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.486
Come on, help me open it.

1699
01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.369
Ma, we caught here
in these damn woods!

1700
01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.841
- Come, help me open the hood, girl.
- Oh, Lord.

1701
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.490
Help me open, you've got to pry it up.

1702
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.042
Come on, on the count of three.
Count of three. Look. One, two, three.

1703
01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.003
Whoo! Yeah!

1704
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.606
When's the last time
you had this thing serviced?

1705
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.648
1972, when I bought it.

1706
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.645
What's wrong with it?

1707
01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.724
We don't know, Barn, hell,
we just got out the car!

1708
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.566
- The hell's wrong with her?
- Ma, I'm scared out here.

1709
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.496
You scared in the house,
you scared in the dark, hush.

1710
01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.806
Ain't nothing out here.

1711
01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.770
No, you know I don't like to be out here
in the dark in these here woods.

1712
01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.080
Nothing wrong with these woods,

1713
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.600
hell, ain't nothing out there.
Hattie, just hush.

1714
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.761
Shh!

1715
01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.683
Is everybody all right?

1716
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.401
Barn, we fine. Hell, we fine,
would you please be quiet?

1717
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.891
Damn, what the hell wrong with her?

1718
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.525
Mabel.

1719
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.925
I hear something out there.

1720
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.480
You don't hear nothing, Hattie. Hell.

1721
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.965
Look, is this the carburetor?

1722
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.800
I don't know nothing about
working on no car.

1723
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.445
Ma.

1724
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.604
Madea!

1725
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.648
Oh, jeez! Oh! Madea!

1726
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.960
What the hell's wrong with you?

1727
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.844
- Madea!
- What? What you running for?

1728
01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.562
Oh, hell, Oh, hell. Hell!

1729
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.123
Madea! Madea!

1730
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.564
Madea!

1731
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.688
- Madea!
- Hattie!

1732
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.888
Mabel! Mabel! Wait for me!

1733
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:14.240
Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

1734
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.081
Help me, Jesus!

1735
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.891
Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

1736
01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.883
Help me, Jesus!

1737
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.200
I need Jesus!

1738
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.725
Oh, Lord, somebody help me,

1739
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.576
I just need Jesus,
come, somebody pray for me.

1740
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.001
What'd I do, what'd I do?
Somebody just needs to pray for me.

1741
01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.048
Oh, I need Jesus! I need...

1742
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.527
You can't smoke in here, Madea.

1743
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.523
Okay, but didn't Moses
have a burning bush?

1744
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.886
I need the lamb of God.

1745
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.525
Would you like to be saved, darling?

1746
01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.648
Oh, yes, I wanna be saved,
will that help me?

1747
01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.200
Oh, praise the Lord,
Hallelujah, that's wonderful!

1748
01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.523
Now do you believe that
Jesus is the son of God?

1749
01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.296
If I have to, that's what
I'm gonna believe.

1750
01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.721
Just, I just need y'all to help me.

1751
01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.201
And you confess your sins?

1752
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.056
Up in here with all these
children up in here?

1753
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.243
Honey, you don't want me confessing
my sin up in here around these men.

1754
01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.163
I'll have all of them blushing.

1755
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.256
You don't know what I used to
do back in the day, baby!

1756
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.681
Wasn't no fun. Bam!

1757
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.046
Pray for me.

1758
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.567
Well, not to Sister Alice,
not to anybody in here, but to Him.

1759
01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.936
You just confess with your mouth
and believe in your heart,

1760
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.560
and you shall be saved,
it's that simple.

1761
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.136
Oh, just like that
and all my problems go away,

1762
01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.016
ain't gonna be no more demons
following me and there's monkeys

1763
01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.485
and everything walking behind me?

1764
01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.211
Well, getting saved doesn't mean
all your troubles won't come,

1765
01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.931
but it'll help you when it do.
I'm a living witness now.

1766
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.650
I confess that Jesus is son of God.

1767
01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.564
I believe. Sha-na-na!
Yes, I believe, help me.

1768
01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.051
Am I saved? I'm saved now!

1769
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.770
- Yes...
- Yes, I'm saved!

1770
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.888
Yes, praise the Lord, I'm saved.

1771
01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.928
Yes, Hallelujah. Thank you.

1772
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.083
Them demons that I keep seeing
and monkeys and clowns...

1773
01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.606
They've been following you. I know.

1774
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.884
Reverend, you anointed just like TDJ.

1775
01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.962
How you know that, Reverend?
How you know that?

1776
01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.883
Uh... Aday told me.

1777
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.325
How she know that?

1778
01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.643
Baby, you got the gift like Joel Osteen,
you got the gift, baby?

1779
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.690
I have a confession. I...

1780
01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.888
We snuck out of the house
and went to the frat party.

1781
01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.045
I'm so sorry, Madea.

1782
01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.043
I already asked the Lord
for forgiveness.

1783
01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.600
But when you came
to the party and shut it down,

1784
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.284
the frat guys got so mad.

1785
01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.885
And they wanted to prank you.

1786
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.610
They hacked into the TV.

1787
01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.809
The lights. The plumbing.
That was all them.

1788
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.376
I heard them talking about it
when the police came to shut it down.

1789
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.643
And when you were in the car
and the zombies came out of the woods,

1790
01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.801
that was them.

1791
01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.927
Yes, ma'am.

1792
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.249
Come on, get some holy water. Come on.

1793
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.043
Jesus working on her,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

1794
01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.690
- Now hold that.
- Hallelujah, Jesus.

1795
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.650
No, no, them words is about to come
out of my mouth, but I'm in a church!

1796
01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.520
- Come on, now, hold it. Hold.
- You better...

1797
01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.126
Oh, Lord.

1798
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.407
Sorry, these words trying to
come up out of my...

1799
01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.007
Don't cuss, Madea, you in a church,
hold yourself. Don't cuss.

1800
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.367
- I bind you, cussing demon!
- Bind him.

1801
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.807
Cussing demon, I bind you!

1802
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.042
You trying to tell me right now,

1803
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.202
that that was them children
that did that?

1804
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.647
To me? And the clown?

1805
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.121
That was them.
And the movement in the attic.

1806
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.326
I'm sorry, Miss Madea.

1807
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.323
You ain't nowhere near
as sorry as them

1808
01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.256
frat boys about to be
for what they done did to me.

1809
01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:19.161
No, no, Miss Madea, Tiffany has
some responsibility in this, I'm sorry.

1810
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.616
I'm gonna tell you right now.

1811
01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.256
I'm going over there and I'm gonna burn
that place down. I'm going right now!

1812
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.169
You just got saved, Miss Madea.

1813
01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.130
Sometimes getting saved
is like a bad perm, Reverend...

1814
01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.850
It just don't take.

1815
01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.400
Now where them boys at?

1816
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.736
I'm going over there
to get them right now.

1817
01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.171
Uh... Uh... Miss Madea...

1818
01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.296
Reverend, I know
you ain't grabbing on me.

1819
01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.401
I know you ain't...

1820
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.845
Do you want them holy hands?

1821
01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.048
Do you want your holy hands, Reverend?

1822
01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.170
I think you just need to calm down.
The Bible says to turn the other cheek.

1823
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.816
Yes, but the Bible
talks about these cheeks.

1824
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.136
What about the cheeks
down at the bottom?

1825
01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.936
Those are the ones I'm going after
'cause I'm gonna tell you right now.

1826
01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.776
What they done did is just absolute,
flat-out wrong.

1827
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.896
I'm going over there and set it off.

1828
01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.016
No, no, no. Miss Madea,
there's gotta be some other way

1829
01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.201
to teach them a lesson.

1830
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.325
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1831
01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.289
Ma, you ain't had
to leave us like that.

1832
01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.646
I know y'all knew where to come.

1833
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.296
They came straight to the church,
didn't they?

1834
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.846
Listen. Hold on. I just
found out what happened.

1835
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.729
It was them frat boys, but listen to me.

1836
01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.882
I got this. Rev, you might be right.

1837
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.376
There might be something
we can go over there and do

1838
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.925
- and get all this straight.
- Yes.

1839
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.240
I got... I got an idea.

1840
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.085
I'm going to try something
very different.

1841
01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.525
This is what we gonna do...

1842
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.360
I oughta bust you...

1843
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.816
Joe, you ain't gonna
believe this.

1844
01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.216
You ain't gonna believe
what them frat boys did.

1845
01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.176
Yeah, I know everything.
I know everything, look here.

1846
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.440
I... Hold the hell on.

1847
01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.971
Look at him.

1848
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.416
So y'all wanna play games
with old people, huh?

1849
01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.010
What is your name, son?

1850
01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.367
Urn, I'm Renaldo,
but everybody calls me Horse.

1851
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.171
Horse? Ooh, can I ride?

1852
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.009
- Hattie, please, damn.
- Hattie, hush.

1853
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.496
I'm gonna tell you
one more time, Hattie,

1854
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.776
you keep talking to him like that,

1855
01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.201
you ain't getting no more
of this damn donkey.

1856
01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.363
So y'all like to play games, huh?
What is wrong with y'all?

1857
01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.761
I'm sorry, we don't wanna get
kicked out of school, please.

1858
01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.096
You worried about
getting kicked out of school,

1859
01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.485
you about to get your ass kicked.

1860
01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.136
I'm gonna get all this
straight right now.

1861
01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.367
Y'all wanna play these games?
I'm calling Brian.

1862
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.363
- I'm calling right now.
- Yeah.

1863
01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.771
<i>Madea, how you doing?</i>

1864
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.286
Brian, you ain't gonna never believe
what your daughter did.

1865
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.805
I need you to come home right now.

1866
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.006
<i>Madea, I don't...</i>

1867
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.176
I don't care what you're doing,
if you don't get here right now,

1868
01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.611
you ain't gonna have no house.

1869
01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.016
- Yes, we gonna get it.
- No, I'm good.

1870
01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.246
- Right now.
- <i>Okay,</i> great.

1871
01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.936
And then she just snuck up
out of this house.

1872
01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.176
That's exactly what she...
Snuck up out of this house, Brian.

1873
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.964
I cannot believe that...

1874
01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.520
I think that you need to just
shut the hell up and listen, boy.

1875
01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.296
Right. You need to get that girl to
come down here and put your foot down.

1876
01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.856
Okay. All right.
But what do I say to her?

1877
01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.896
You grab her by the throat,
you say, "Look here, you little..."

1878
01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.656
Daddy, if you say something
bad about my daughter...

1879
01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.762
Joe, don't you call that child
no bad name, hush.

1880
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.001
Call her.

1881
01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.576
You need to call her down here
and set this thing straight.

1882
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.921
Get this child in order,
she is running all over you.

1883
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.161
You need to get her in order.

1884
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.720
- Okay. Tiffany!
- What?

1885
01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.167
Honey, can you come downstairs, please?

1886
01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.480
What the hell you doing?

1887
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.921
Boy, what the hell wrong with you?
Call her from your nuts.

1888
01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.001
Well, now that may be how it sounds,
Joe, 'cause, he only got one.

1889
01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.842
Boy, I'm trying to help you.
I'm trying to help you.

1890
01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.161
You're sitting here
like a little me-otch.

1891
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.567
Stop using that language
in my house, okay?

1892
01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.246
Listen up, everybody here.
I'll try this my way,

1893
01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.245
and if it doesn't work,
then I will resort to 1938,

1894
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.210
where you beat the hell out of your kids
and everything was okay.

1895
01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.805
All right? I'll get arrested.

1896
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.564
I'll have warrants.
I'll be like you guys.

1897
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.616
I'm running from the police.
I'm running from the po-po.

1898
01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.210
I don't live that way.

1899
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.887
Nigga. Nigga. Your way ain't never work.

1900
01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.176
We trying to tell you the way
we did it in the old school.

1901
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.884
All this new shit ain't working.

1902
01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.880
That's why all these children
killing each other.

1903
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.296
That's why all these children
ain't got no respect for nobody.

1904
01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.209
This new shit don't work.

1905
01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.611
Tiffany!

1906
01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.200
Tell her you better get your ass down
them steps right damn now.

1907
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.525
Get down these stairs right now,
your dad would like to talk to you,

1908
01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.002
have a conversation about some of
your behavior, young lady.

1909
01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.209
Find your way down these stairs,
right now.

1910
01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.202
Look, she's coming. See? Duh.

1911
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.206
What?

1912
01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.964
Girl, did that child say, "What"?

1913
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.336
Oh, somebody help me,
y'all better hold me.

1914
01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.441
Somebody better hold me.

1915
01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.524
Tiffany, hear me clearly
and answer this question, okay?

1916
01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.201
Be very careful with your answer.
All right?

1917
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.480
'Cause your life may depend on it. Um...

1918
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.050
Did you sneak out of this house

1919
01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.521
and go to that frat party
after I told you not to?

1920
01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.601
So What if I did?

1921
01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.409
I told you not to go.

1922
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.051
Mmm. So I did. Get over it.

1923
01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:41.411
If you don't snatch that heifer up
by her new growth and sling her

1924
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.448
through the air like
a helicopter, you better...

1925
01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.966
Where are you going,
I'm talking to you.

1926
01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.123
I'm done talking to you.
I'm going back to bed.

1927
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.611
Oh, my God.

1928
01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.648
Jesus, fix him.

1929
01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.524
Okay.

1930
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.696
I tried, that's it, I tried.

1931
01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.484
- I did what I could do.
- Our turn.

1932
01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.210
No, no, hold on.
What're you gonna do?

1933
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.696
You tell her,
"Baby, if you think you're grown,

1934
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.896
you're gonna have to get your ass
out of here and go get you a job."

1935
01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.616
Don't no child supposed to be up in
your house talking to you like that.

1936
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.244
The house where you pay all the bills.

1937
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.560
What the hell is wrong with you

1938
01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.696
letting this child talk to you
like that? She got to...

1939
01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.816
She got to get her ass...

1940
01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.800
She got to get her ass out of here.

1941
01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.971
I am not putting my 17-year-old daughter
out of the house on the streets

1942
01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.929
so she can do
all kinds of criminal things.

1943
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.320
She's not gonna grow up like you.

1944
01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.800
She's not gonna grow up like...

1945
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.088
Other people have done.
I'm not doing it.

1946
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.496
What's the worst that
can happen to her?

1947
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.251
Turn to prostitution? Drugs?
End up in the bus station,

1948
01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.816
some pimp pick her up
and put her out on the street

1949
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.966
pimping her out for years?

1950
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.203
Hell, how you think I met your mama?

1951
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.045
You can't put her out?
Oh, you can't put her out?

1952
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.281
Oh, oh, you can't.

1953
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.089
Is it too tough for you
to put her out?

1954
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.128
You're such a nice man,
you can't put her out.

1955
01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.361
I'll put her ass out.

1956
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.204
- And me, too.
- They swigging on

1957
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.736
- testosterone and all them...
- Y'all go on, go on. Come on.

1958
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.096
Come on, y'all come on.
Let's go. Move!

1959
01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.216
Wait a minute, what are you doing,
what are you doing with my daughter?

1960
01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.971
What... Hold on. Just...
What are you gonna do

1961
01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.680
when you get up here
is what I wanna know.

1962
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.807
Turn the damn lights on,
turn them on right now.

1963
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.689
Get your tail up out of that bed!

1964
01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.683
What the...

1965
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.569
Go ahead! Finish your statement

1966
01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.722
so I can bust your head
to the white meat.

1967
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.776
Yeah, that's right,
she's gonna bust it to the white meat,

1968
01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.376
and I'm gonna bust it
to your damn cranium.

1969
01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.600
Say what you was about to say.

1970
01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.251
Let them words fall up
out of your lips, little girl.

1971
01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.202
Oh, no... No, what are you
doing with my stuff?

1972
01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.523
No, no, these are not your things.
Your things is what you go in the store

1973
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.568
and you pay for with
your hard-earned money.

1974
01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.689
Your daddy bought all this stuff,
so don't none of this belong to you.

1975
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.684
This is called borrowed stuff.
Rented. Do you understand?

1976
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.091
This don't belong to you.

1977
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.090
Oh, I like this right here!

1978
01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.089
Oh, yes, I love it!

1979
01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.447
- You can have it.
- No, you can't, that's mine!

1980
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.285
Oh, try to take it. Try to take it.

1981
01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.091
I wanna see her do that, babe.
Please try to take it from Bam.

1982
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.766
Please try to take it from her.

1983
01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.770
What is wrong with you old people?

1984
01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.136
Say that one more damn time.

1985
01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.209
Your daddy works hard, day and night,
to buy all this stuff for you,

1986
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.976
and you gonna sit up here
with all this attitude?

1987
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.570
- Baby, you got to go.
- Go where?

1988
01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.291
I don't know but you've got to
get the hell up out of here.

1989
01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.009
- Dad.
- No, no...

1990
01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.616
He ain't gonna say nothing.
I wish he would say something.

1991
01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.096
Brian, say something, so I can
bust you in the back of your damn head.

1992
01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.240
Please say something to her.

1993
01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.685
I like this thing right here.

1994
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.336
I can rock this
like the young people say.

1995
01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.930
I can rock these.

1996
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.048
Where you going to rock it?
On your damn ankle, Bam?

1997
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.447
Give me that damn
pair of pants, you think...

1998
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.124
That is mine.

1999
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.486
Try and take it from me.

2000
01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.891
Dad!

2001
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.570
Uh, don't look at me.

2002
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.642
See, that is the problem.

2003
01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.609
Okay, you're always
letting people run over you.

2004
01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.002
You let Mom run over you,
you let her husband run over you.

2005
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.162
- You let me run over you.
- Uh-oh.

2006
01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.208
There it is. I knew she was
angry about something.

2007
01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.216
Something hit that nerve.
There it is, what happened?

2008
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.925
Your morn did not
run over me, Tiffany.

2009
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.721
Oh, so her having an affair in this
house isn't her running over you?

2010
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.656
Brian, I believe that's
running over you, right there.

2011
01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.091
I believe that's running over you.

2012
01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.440
You know about that?

2013
01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.010
Of course I know about that, okay?

2014
01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.128
Do you know that Morn
has no respect for you?

2015
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.050
When are you gonna start
standing up for yourself?

2016
01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.970
You know what, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

2017
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.963
I'm gonna start standing up for myself.

2018
01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.320
Right now. Right now.

2019
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.164
- Pack it up.
- Yep!

2020
01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.016
- Everything. Let's pack it up.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2021
01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.696
That's it, Brian.
Pack her stuff up. Pack it up!

2022
01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.449
Okay, this has to be a joke.

2023
01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.966
No, I'm not joking at all.
I'm telling you right now.

2024
01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.576
You obviously know everything that
went on between me and your mother,

2025
01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.776
you know everything that happened.

2026
01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.856
Forgive me for trying to
protect you and your brother

2027
01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.961
from what was going on.

2028
01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.736
From trying to protect you from the pain
that was happening in this house.

2029
01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.526
Listen to me. It takes a stronger person
to leave a situation

2030
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.490
than it is to stay and fight
in a situation that's not worth it.

2031
01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.927
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
Obviously you don't.

2032
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.446
So you clearly don't appreciate
anything that I've ever done.

2033
01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.409
So it's time for you to go.
You got to go!

2034
01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.325
Go where?

2035
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.368
I don't know.
But it's obvious you're grown.

2036
01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.771
You can make your own decisions.

2037
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.536
If you cannot abide
by the rules in this house,

2038
01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.166
then you are not allowed here.
Do you understand?

2039
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.049
Don't cry. Tiffany,
I can't do the tears.

2040
01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.487
I'm not gonna do the tears.
I've had enough of this.

2041
01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.607
I've had enough.

2042
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.526
Okay.

2043
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.405
I love you.
Do you understand that?

2044
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.086
But you have to abide
by the rules in this house.

2045
01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.721
If I say it, you have to abide by it.
Do you understand?

2046
01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.521
I know you're a teenager. I know that
a lot's going on. And listen to me,

2047
01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.170
I want you to go out
and live your life.

2048
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.566
I want you to make mistakes.

2049
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.016
But I don't want you
to make any mistakes

2050
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.691
that's gonna cause you
to ruin your life.

2051
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.280
You shouldn't have gone to that party.

2052
01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.368
Anything could have happened
to you over there.

2053
01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.283
I'm not trying to run your life.

2054
01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.681
I'm trying to protect you
as your father.

2055
01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.163
And if you cannot understand that,
then you have to go. ls that clear?

2056
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.242
- Okay.
- So tell me right now.

2057
01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.005
Are you staying in this house
and abiding by my rules

2058
01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.242
or are we all gonna
put you out of here?

2059
01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.163
I'm staying. I'm listening to you.

2060
01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.004
- Apologize.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

2061
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.731
- Mean it.
- I'm sorry.

2062
01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.529
I still think you need to whoop her ass.

2063
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.808
One good time.

2064
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.085
All right. Listen.

2065
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.856
Little girl, let me explain
something to you, honey.

2066
01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.451
That's what parents be trying to do.
Set you on the right path.

2067
01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.285
Parents aren't perfect.
They make all kinds of mistakes.

2068
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.736
And when you start trying
to make them perfect,

2069
01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.411
you mess up thinking that they are.
They are not God.

2070
01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.245
They are parents.
And they try to do the best for you.

2071
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.736
And you sitting there
and I know you're mad

2072
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.856
at your mama for what she did

2073
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.216
and you're mad at your daddy
for him not standing up.

2074
01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.526
All that is clear, honey.

2075
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.416
But what you need to
understand about that is this.

2076
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.936
Forgive your mama, forgive your daddy,
for the things they didn't know

2077
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.246
and you help them figure it out.

2078
01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.209
Since you wanna act like you so grown.

2079
01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.327
You understand?

2080
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.285
Yes.

2081
01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.840
And I'm gonna tell you right now,
I'm mad as hell at you

2082
01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.800
for letting them frat boys come up
in here and trick me up in this house.

2083
01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.650
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2084
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.480
Uh-oh. That's the po-po.

2085
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.608
I know the po-po knock anywhere.

2086
01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.569
- It probably is.
- Lord have mercy.

2087
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.642
Well, Brian. Go open the door.

2088
01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.802
Yeah. Of course you want me
to get the door.

2089
01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.325
I'm the only one without a warrant.

2090
01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.409
We're not done talking.

2091
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.606
Police at the door.

2092
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.844
But, Brian, I've got a prescription.
I'm still legal.

2093
01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.410
Let's go see what's going on.

2094
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.569
Yeah. Who is it? Officer.
What's going on?

2095
01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.286
- We need your daughter, Tiffany.
- Tiffany? For what?

2096
01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.120
What is going on?

2097
01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.376
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

2098
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.324
- You know Aday Walker?
- Yeah.

2099
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.363
When was the last time
you talked to her?

2100
01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.646
Um, last night.

2101
01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.087
- She was with you at the frat house?
- Yeah.

2102
01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.322
- Wait a minute, what's going on?
- Come on.

2103
01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.402
No, no, no, no.
Until you tell me what's going on,

2104
01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.641
she's not going anywhere.

2105
01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:33.846
Sir, this girl is missing.

2106
01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.843
- What?
- And we need to find her.

2107
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.763
Her parents are worried sick.

2108
01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.171
Go on with them.

2109
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.576
- What? Dad, no!
- Yeah, go on with them.

2110
01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.762
I'm right behind you, okay? Go on.

2111
01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.365
- Go on.
- Dad.

2112
01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.329
Come on.

2113
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.528
You gonna put handcuffs on her?

2114
01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.489
I'm right behind you,
let me get my keys.

2115
01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.280
Go home! Come back next year.

2116
01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.171
Peasants, the party's over!

2117
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.320
Police! Open up!

2118
01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.129
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no.

2119
01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.456
What do they want?
What do they want?

2120
01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.323
- What do they want?
- We don't know.

2121
01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.564
Dino knows. It's about that 17-year-old
charlatan from last night.

2122
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.847
You shut up, Dino.

2123
01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.600
Clean up. Clean up.
Put it in the basement.

2124
01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.682
Police! Open up!

2125
01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.405
Open up! Now!

2126
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.403
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

2127
01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.800
- Talk.
- Spit it out.

2128
01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.763
Go. Go.

2129
01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.330
What now?

2130
01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.562
Come on, cops again?

2131
01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.563
- Open up!
- Worst party ever.

2132
01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.246
Let's get out of here.
Go. Let's go, let's go, go.

2133
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.056
This is your
last chance to open the door.

2134
01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.650
What the hell?

2135
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.526
- She disappeared last night.
- Nobody saw her?

2136
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.967
- Dino. Dino. Dino. Dino.
- No. No. No.

2137
01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.610
Dino! Dino!

2138
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:39.364
- This dude was with her.
- No! Nothing.

2139
01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.487
What'd you do?

2140
01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.131
Wasn't me!

2141
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.010
Police! We got a warrant
to search these premises.

2142
01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.289
Everybody outside.
Handcuffed. Let's go.

2143
01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.362
- We didn't do anything.
- Let's go! Let's go!

2144
01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.363
Everybody outside.

2145
01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.410
Come on.

2146
01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.481
Keep it moving.

2147
01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.685
Rain Matheson,
Leah Devero. And she was here.

2148
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.001
And she's underage just like this girl.

2149
01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.525
You know that.

2150
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.524
Did you bring those girls up here
and you knew they were underage?

2151
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.284
No, no. We just invited them.

2152
01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.600
But we didn't know their age.

2153
01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.364
- We didn't know anything.
- Yes, you did.

2154
01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.442
Both them girls
know damn well she is underage.

2155
01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.807
She underage.
And you took her down to that party.

2156
01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.856
That's right. That's why
you're in trouble right now.

2157
01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.405
- No.
- Stop that damn lying.

2158
01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.616
You've been friends with her
since y'all was in the fourth grade.

2159
01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.449
How the hell you ain't know
how old she was?

2160
01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.640
- We swear. We didn't know.
- We didn't know anything.

2161
01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.570
- It was them. I saw it.
- Shut up, Jonathan.

2162
01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.483
We found a body in the basement.

2163
01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.656
Is it my daughter?

2164
01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:41.966
No, no, not Aday.

2165
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.965
We are waiting on the medical examiner,
but you can identify the body.

2166
01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.136
See, that's what your daddy
was trying to tell you, honey.

2167
01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.656
This is what I was trying
to get you to understand.

2168
01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.696
Your parents ain't lame
'cause they tell you not to go out.

2169
01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.290
Not to be texting and driving.

2170
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.323
All that stuff is bad.
Y'all kill people.

2171
01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.609
And now this girl is up in there dead.
She is dead. She dead.

2172
01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.921
Y'all are under arrest
for the murder of Aday Walker.

2173
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.400
It was them! It was them!

2174
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:07.165
Dad, I'm sorry. Dad, help me.

2175
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.960
Listen, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

2176
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.924
- I didn't do anything.
- I will do my best to get you out.

2177
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.889
I don't know if I can, but I'll try.

2178
01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.602
Big, strong boys.

2179
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.803
Hey, yep. Y'all finna get it. Yeah.

2180
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.816
I like the cryin' baby.

2181
01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.000
Who is this?

2182
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.091
Who cryin'?

2183
01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.606
Homie, you gonna hug
a man from the back.

2184
01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.650
Nothing wrong with that though.
Good hugging in the shower.

2185
01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.769
Soap flying everywhere.
So romantic.

2186
01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.256
So you killed her
and you crying about it?

2187
01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.089
We didn't kill her. I promise.

2188
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.561
There's a dead body,
you're on the bus with us.

2189
01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.130
This is messed up, bro.

2190
01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.931
Hold tight. Be quiet.
And we'll be back.

2191
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.331
These are your new friends.

2192
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.096
Ain't gonna be no more
frat parties and stuff.

2193
01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:58.408
'Cause y'all killed a girl
and you're going down for it.

2194
01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.608
Who is this?

2195
01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.768
Treat her nice. She is a minor.

2196
01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.808
But those two, they are 18.

2197
01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.803
- Who?
- No, we're not. No, no.

2198
01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.360
No, no, no. That's not us.

2199
01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.330
I sure would like to
twist your hair, girl.

2200
01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.136
- No, no. I don't like braids.
- Me either.

2201
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.811
They're not a cute look.

2202
01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.848
My hair doesn't twist, I swear.

2203
01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.082
It's just really straight,
and, like, bendy,

2204
01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.844
and it's really not cute on me.

2205
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.576
Well, you can twist mine, baby.

2206
01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.126
No, no.
Our manicures won't let us twist.

2207
01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:31.000
- They'd get caught.
- I'm sorry, miss. Uh...

2208
01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.003
My name is Walter.

2209
01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.765
Oh, my God, this just
keeps getting worse.

2210
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.568
Wait, wait, wait.
That's my momma and my daddy.

2211
01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.680
Momma, daddy.
No, wait, wait. That's my sister.

2212
01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.249
- You killed my sister!
- No, no, no. They're black.

2213
01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.243
They're not even related to you!

2214
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.922
Lord have mercy.

2215
01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.521
Ooh!

2216
01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.409
Hey, baby. Lord have mercy.

2217
01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.086
- How did I do as a cop?
- You did all right, baby,

2218
01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.216
but I don't want you to have
to run after nobody here.

2219
01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.280
'Cause I don't know if you
gonna be able to keep up.

2220
01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.451
You know damn well I ain't the police.
I couldn't be the police.

2221
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.409
I know. Hell, your record
longer than mine.

2222
01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.136
You calling me
'cause you're getting robbed,

2223
01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.400
I might rob your ass, too.

2224
01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:28.016
I ain't the real police.

2225
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.765
I want that little Jonathan to see

2226
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.600
what it feel like
to get pranked by somebody.

2227
01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.722
Since he always doing all
the damn pranking.

2228
01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.850
They're touching me. Please!

2229
01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:47.730
I don't know, guys.
This is just wrong.

2230
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.320
Look, come on, now, Madea,
this is enough. Let's help them.

2231
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.936
Maybe you better watch out
for that little one.

2232
01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.000
He look like he getting ready
to get raped for real.

2233
01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.176
Go and get 'em off the bus.
He'll be all right.

2234
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.806
Go and get 'em off the bus.
But take your time.

2235
01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.571
Hell, I'm enjoying this!

2236
01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.489
Y'all, sit down.

2237
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.682
All the little killers, come on.
Y'all come on.

2238
01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.680
Aday, come on out here, baby.
Rise from the dead.

2239
01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.643
Jesus, say Lazarus, please come up.

2240
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.768
- Coming, Miss Madea.
- Thank you!

2241
01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.683
Hey, she come up from the...

2242
01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.809
Did good with that makeup, girl.
Just all bloody.

2243
01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.201
Come on, keep walking.
And hurry up.

2244
01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.363
Oh, no. Shh, shh. Here they come.
Here they come. Stand there like Carrie.

2245
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.129
Keep walking. Come on.
Don't say nothing. Keep walking.

2246
01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.884
See, no... No hugs necessary.

2247
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.696
- I love you so...
- Just keep walking.

2248
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.644
You are so wrong for that.

2249
01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.087
I know. But I'm alive.

2250
01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.243
I know. I'm sorry. So sorry.

2251
01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.923
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Don't do that to us again.

2252
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.163
I hope you learned your lesson.
I hope all of you learned your lesson.

2253
01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.562
- This is just wrong.
- Trust me, sir. We did.

2254
01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.042
Well, Miss Madea, I'm sorry
we pranked you and...

2255
01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.485
You get my point for the prank?

2256
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.562
Trust me, your prank,
we get it now. We get it.

2257
01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.768
Good. Okay, good.
Thank you so much.

2258
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.730
So, how do you know
all those guys in there?

2259
01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.880
All the people came from
my neighborhood. All of 'em.

2260
01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.127
That's all my people from my hood.

2261
01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.170
How did you get
all these fake officers?

2262
01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.816
Hell, Brian know
a whole bunch of people.

2263
01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.056
That's how I got a fake officer.

2264
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.856
You know I don't mess
around with no real officer.

2265
01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:26.247
Oh, no, Madea.
Those aren't fake officers.

2266
01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.401
They're not fake officers.

2267
01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.016
Those are real officers.
Who do you think I am?

2268
01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.963
Federal prosecutor.
I brought the real officers.

2269
01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.929
- Say what?
- Those aren't fake officers.

2270
01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.009
- These the real police?
- Yeah.

2271
01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.449
- Real po-po? One time?
- Yeah.

2272
01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.883
Okay, I can handle this.

2273
01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.323
Oh, shit.

2274
01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.722
Wait, so all the officers
in our house right now are real?

2275
01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.521
Now there's nothing in there you
have to be afraid of, is there, son?

2276
01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.682
We found marijuana in the house.

2277
01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.809
You ain't got no prescription.
You ain't got no prescription.

2278
01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.086
Hey, don't I know you?

2279
01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.804
Let's ride.

2280
01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.176
I know I know you from somewhere!

2281
01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.361
Madea!

2282
01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.962
- Madea!
- Hey, where you going?

2283
01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.963
He ain't gon' never catch me...

2284
01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.456
That's the way to get rid of them.
Come on, let's go home.

2285
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.244
- Madea! Madea!
- I'm sorry.

2286
01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.010
You are learning.

2287
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.809
Madea, come back and get me!

2288
01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.456
I remember I was sitting there
trying to teach you how to read.

2289
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.960
And I told you to use the
word "bishop" in a sentence.

2290
01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.247
And you said,
"The bishop was at the church."

2291
01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.976
I said
"Boy, that ain't what that word means."

2292
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.136
Then you got mad at me
because I was telling you

2293
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.525
what the word really means.

2294
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.329
Then you say
"Daddy, use it in a sentence."

2295
01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.370
So I use it in a sentence for you.
This is what I say.

2296
01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.169
"Bishop", this is what it means.

2297
01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.208
"Your mama came in the house
drunk, falling down

2298
01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.930
and I had to pick the bishop."

2299
01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.447
Whoop that ass.

2300
01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.168
- We going. Hold on here.
- Mabel!

2301
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.090
That's all right.

2302
01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.816
This son of a bitch gonna
start one of these days.

2303
01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.126
Madea!

2304
01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.525
Got any oil in there?

2305
01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.001
That's all right.
I got everything in here.

2306
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.971
Don't look like you got
no gas because we still ain't left.

2307
01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.810
Yo, man, wait.

2308
01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.167
Remember that time.
Y'all got to stop laughing.

2309
01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.641
You all over my lines.
Stop jumping my lines.

2310
01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.480
Who the hell is that
up there walking for real? Now hold on.

2311
01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.045
Hold the hell on.

2312
01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.043
Hold the hell on. Who's upstairs?

2313
01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.963
I told Kanye I could've rapped with him,

2314
01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.720
he wouldn't let me
go on the road with him.

2315
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.408
- You see, I'm on the canes now.
- Yes, I see it.

2316
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.369
Yeah.

2317
01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.202
Hell, I'm killing the cameraman.

2318
01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.965
All of them got carbon
monoxide poisoning by now.

2319
01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.371
Here we go.

2320
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.363
You got to go home.
After I'm done.

2321
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.016
I ain't doing all that
cuddling and holding,

2322
01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.088
acting like I like you.
I ain't finna do that.

2323
01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.527
I wanna be in my bed by myself.

2324
01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.364
Thank you. I'll see you later.

2325
01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.681
Your 20 dollars is on the dresser.

2326
01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.571
Look at...

2327
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.120
I ain't gonna tell her what happened.

2328
01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.761
Do you know what a ho is?
No, you don't. Be glad.

2329
01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.923
Well, you do. Well, your mama.
Your mama was a ho.

2330
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.520
But that's all right.
That's all right.

2331
01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.086
God gotta make room for everybody.

2332
01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:01.403
Yeah, when she died I had to bury her
on her belly to give her ass a break.

2333
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.484
'Cause she was just worn out.

2334
01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.210
But last year I was actually a ghost.

2335
01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.203
Wait, you just said
you don't celebrate ghosts.

2336
01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.611
Oh, no, the Holy Ghost.

2337
01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.441
Can somebody just be on a script?

2338
01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.126
See, we've said some things twice.

2339
01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.204
Yeah, I've been telling them
that she went down there to the doctor.

2340
01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.489
And the doctor told her
that she can't have sex for a while.

2341
01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.130
That's what the doctor told her.

2342
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.568
I said, well,
"What did the dentist say?"

2343
01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.610
Oh, shit.
It's too late for this shit.
