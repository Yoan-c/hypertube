1
00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:31.415
I've always wondered if you hit a mime,
does he make a sound?

2
00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:41.753
Well, now you know.

3
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.920
I lost my teeth.

4
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.630
What is he saying?

5
00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:57.035
I don't know, something about "teesh"?

6
00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.205
Oh, he lost his teeth.

7
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.290
Terry.

8
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.460
Hey! You sons of bitches
ain't going anywhere!

9
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.423
I saw the whole damn thing.
I'm calling the police.

10
00:02:10.418 --> 00:02:11.668
We are the police.

11
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.290
"All oppression creates a state of war."
Simone de Beauvoir.

12
00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:13.436
No, it's Pierre-Joseph Proudhon,
the father of anarchism.

13
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.790
It's not Simone de Beauvoir,
the feminist existentialist.

14
00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.786
- I bet you 50 bucks.
- I'll take that bet.

15
00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:21.536
- Hey, Uncle Terry.
- How's it hanging, César?

16
00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:31.916
Little early in the day, Terry.

17
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.131
- It's midnight in Tokyo.
- Mmm.

18
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.710
- Hey, Uncle Terry.
- Hey, Lil' Bob.

19
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.040
Where's my Xbox?

20
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.881
How the fuck should I know?

21
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.852
Oh, you know what? It's up my ass.
Do you wanna go see it?

22
00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:44.376
It's in the den.

23
00:03:45.168 --> 00:03:46.748
I hit your car, Bob.

24
00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:48.998
- Again?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.455
Is it bad?

26
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:53.165
We should take my car.

27
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.840
You had a nice swim, honey?

28
00:03:55.918 --> 00:03:56.998
My eyes hurt.

29
00:03:57.085 --> 00:04:00.205
I told you, Bob.
You put too much chlorine in that pool.

30
00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:02.543
No, no, no. I followed
those instructions to a T.

31
00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:03.666
He's been up to something.

32
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:05.171
- No, I haven't.
- "No, I haven't."

33
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:07.921
All little innocent Little Lord fucking
Fauntleroy over here.

34
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.171
- Stop it.
- I've been itching all weekend.

35
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:11.491
I'm trying to digest over here.

36
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.110
When was the last time you had sex?

37
00:04:14.043 --> 00:04:15.133
Thursday.

38
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.670
And when did you start itching?

39
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.791
Saturday, in late afternoon,
early evening.

40
00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:20.956
It's thrush.

41
00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:23.341
What's thrush?

42
00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:25.841
- I wore a condom.
- It don't matter.

43
00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:27.644
- What do I do about it?
- You go to a drugstore.

44
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:30.088
They'll give you some cream
or something. You'll be fine.

45
00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:31.788
What's thrush, Pop?

46
00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:33.876
Thrush is a small
to medium-sized songbird.

47
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.160
Now, get the fuck out of here.

48
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:41.251
Can you guys not discuss his genital
complaints while I'm trying to eat?

49
00:04:41.335 --> 00:04:42.455
Is that too much to ask for?

50
00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:44.585
This looks like dick and balls now.

51
00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:48.463
- See you later, Dolores.
- See you later, Terry.

52
00:04:49.043 --> 00:04:50.173
He's fucking broke it, Mom.

53
00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:52.541
No! Oh, you know what?

54
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.126
- It is broken.
- Mom!

55
00:04:57.168 --> 00:04:58.338
Don't litter, man.

56
00:04:58.418 --> 00:05:01.269
You're gonna make me look bad in front
of all of my fucking white neighbours.

57
00:05:01.293 --> 00:05:03.173
Let's go fuck some scumbags.

58
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.880
What are they doing now?

59
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.560
Looking at the exhibits. What the fuck
do you think they're doing?

60
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:22.791
- This is a waste of time.
- No, it's not.

61
00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:25.561
What do you think the Webb brothers
are doing in a fucking balloon museum?

62
00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:28.035
You think they're researching
the history of aeronautics? No.

63
00:05:28.335 --> 00:05:30.915
Look at this guy point.
You're not fooling anybody, buddy.

64
00:05:31.376 --> 00:05:32.976
You think they're gonna heist the place?

65
00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:36.625
Well, it's popular with the yokels,
but I reckon it's just a meet.

66
00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:39.593
- Oh. Hold it right there. Yeah.
- Here? Here? Right here?

67
00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:40.838
The light is perfect.

68
00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:43.593
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's really nice.

69
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:47.671
That's Jim Harris
and his fucking yo-yo.

70
00:05:49.585 --> 00:05:51.205
Thought he was inside.

71
00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:53.503
He broke out of Riker's Island
two months ago.

72
00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:55.031
Who's the other guy
with the kid?

73
00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:57.875
No idea. What kind of bum
brings his kid to a meet, though?

74
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.686
- Eyes here. Eyes here.
- I don't even see you.

75
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.130
Why am I looking there?

76
00:06:01.543 --> 00:06:02.593
There we go.

77
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.341
- Oh.
- Look.

78
00:06:05.418 --> 00:06:07.248
Yo-yos were once, um,

79
00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:08.875
- outlawed in Damascus.
- Huh!

80
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.880
It was believed that
they were causing a drought.

81
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.960
Look at all those fucking assholes working.

82
00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.836
Suckers!

83
00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:21.383
Welcome back, boys!

84
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.540
How did we enjoy our sabbatical?

85
00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:25.269
It was very pleasant,
it was very relaxing.

86
00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:26.503
I masturbated a lot.

87
00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:28.335
"Enforced sabbatical", I should have said.

88
00:06:28.668 --> 00:06:29.878
What's a "sabbatical"?

89
00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:32.288
Okay.

90
00:06:32.376 --> 00:06:34.416
So Laurel and Hardy here, huh?

91
00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:35.841
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

92
00:06:35.918 --> 00:06:38.668
Siegfried and Roy, Sacco and Vanzetti,
Abelard and Héloïse.

93
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:39.841
Is this a quiz?

94
00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:41.168
No, it's not a quiz.

95
00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:44.423
This is your last chance.

96
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:45.751
OK?

97
00:06:45.835 --> 00:06:46.995
This is it.

98
00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:49.245
There'll be no more suspensions from duty.

99
00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:50.375
That's great!

100
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.540
You will be out on your asses next time.

101
00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:53.666
Oh, that's not great.

102
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:55.227
You'd be out on your
asses already, frankly,

103
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.061
if the powers that be could prove
some of the rumours I've been hearing.

104
00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.811
Yeah, but you know what they say
about rumours, though.

105
00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:01.315
Rumours are the mothers of invention.

106
00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:03.246
No, necessity's the mother of invention.

107
00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:04.415
What are rumours, then?

108
00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:06.291
- Rumours are...
<i>- Silencio!</i>

109
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.290
Assaulting a fellow officer,
that's one thing.

110
00:07:10.376 --> 00:07:13.586
Bribery and corruption charges
against you and that's it,

111
00:07:13.668 --> 00:07:14.748
that's goodnight, Irene.

112
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.415
We were provoked, man.

113
00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:18.291
- Bob was provoked!
- Same thing.

114
00:07:18.918 --> 00:07:20.378
Look, fellas.

115
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.380
I agree with you
about the race issue. OK?

116
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.750
I'm married to a chink myself,
for Christ's sake.

117
00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:27.915
I got chink kids.

118
00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:29.745
Look at their faces.

119
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.040
- Wow.
- Those are good-looking boys.

120
00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.745
I know how you felt, Bob, believe me.

121
00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:38.035
But still, that's no excuse
for assaulting a fellow officer.

122
00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:39.706
Doesn't matter what they say.

123
00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.793
He called me a wetback!
He knows damn well I was born here!

124
00:07:42.876 --> 00:07:44.786
He's a big, fat, racist pig is what he is!

125
00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:48.126
Yes!
He's a big, fat, racist pig. Granted.

126
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.290
No argument there, guys.

127
00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:51.586
But look around.

128
00:07:51.668 --> 00:07:54.038
This is the police department.

129
00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:56.786
We're surrounded
by big, fat, racist pigs.

130
00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:59.336
So work with me here, OK?

131
00:07:59.543 --> 00:08:01.753
Now, what have we learned here?

132
00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:04.085
Don't assault a fellow officer,

133
00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:06.786
even if... even if he is a racist pig.

134
00:08:07.043 --> 00:08:08.753
Yes. And?

135
00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:10.706
- Something about rumours.
- Rumours.

136
00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:12.133
No.

137
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.710
Chinese kids?

138
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.670
- No.
- Oh, oh, oh.

139
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:18.171
Bribery and corruption.

140
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:20.631
Yes, bribery and corruption!

141
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.170
What about bribery and corruption?

142
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:24.001
Oh, there's a part two.

143
00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:25.335
Uh...

144
00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:27.463
Don't get involved with it?

145
00:08:27.543 --> 00:08:30.383
Don't get involved with it
in any way, shape or form.

146
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.840
Bribery and corruption, bad!

147
00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:33.838
Excellent!

148
00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:36.748
Progress has been made!

149
00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:38.875
Exeunt stage left.

150
00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:49.625
Hey, who's that asshole
used to pal around with Harris?

151
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.540
Negro gentleman,
got pinched for the toasters.

152
00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:52.706
Reggie Hayes.

153
00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:54.003
Reggie Hayes.

154
00:08:55.418 --> 00:08:58.498
He, uh, changed it, though, didn't he?
Changed his name.

155
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.250
Joined the Nation of Islam. Reggie X.

156
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.843
Reggie X!

157
00:09:06.126 --> 00:09:07.336
Fuckin'...

158
00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:08.961
Who's this?

159
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.290
- Glen Campbell.
- Great song.

160
00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:14.666
Masterpiece.

161
00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:20.211
Do you see him?

162
00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:23.706
Probably skulking somewhere.

163
00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:26.043
That's what these criminal types do.

164
00:09:26.126 --> 00:09:27.206
Skulk.

165
00:09:27.418 --> 00:09:29.038
Oh, there he is.

166
00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:30.593
Reggie!

167
00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:32.418
<i>As salaam alaikum.</i>

168
00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:35.961
Doesn't seem very pleased
to see us, Terry.

169
00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:37.836
What's the craic, lads?

170
00:09:38.418 --> 00:09:41.288
You know how to read, don't you,
you Mick bastard?

171
00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:43.415
Or would that be too much to ask?

172
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.131
I'm actually dyslexic. All right?

173
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.500
And I find that statement
to be highly discriminatory.

174
00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:50.785
Are you an actor?

175
00:09:51.418 --> 00:09:53.538
Because they all
seem to be dyslexic nowadays.

176
00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:54.866
It used to be called stupidity.

177
00:09:55.668 --> 00:09:57.378
You know these fucking pricks, do you?

178
00:10:02.418 --> 00:10:03.578
You shouldn't have done that.

179
00:10:03.626 --> 00:10:05.916
Well, what's he gonna do?
Tell his momma?

180
00:10:06.293 --> 00:10:07.543
God!

181
00:10:08.543 --> 00:10:10.383
What the fuck? I ain't done shit!

182
00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:12.376
Oh, what's that, Terry?

183
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.290
It sure ain't origami, Bob.

184
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.630
You gotta be kidding me.

185
00:10:15.793 --> 00:10:18.673
I suspect it may well be
what the authorities would call

186
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.380
a controlled substance.

187
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.540
No!

188
00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:28.498
Mmm.

189
00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:29.705
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:29.793 --> 00:10:31.311
That is most definitely
a controlled substance.

191
00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:33.186
And you say you found this
on the defendant's person, Detective?

192
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.920
- Is that correct?
- It was hidden in his anus, Your Honour.

193
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:38.541
Oh, you dirty motherfucker!
You dirty motherfucker!

194
00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:39.996
You're a dealer now, Reggie.

195
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.000
You two are fucked up.

196
00:10:45.585 --> 00:10:46.811
You still running around
with Jimmy Harris?

197
00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:49.475
Not since back in the day,
before the motherfucker moved up a gear.

198
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:51.811
I guess some people's ambitions
go beyond selling toasters, you know?

199
00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:54.227
OK, you know what? You don't even
know the whole level I'm on.

200
00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:56.251
These were designer
fucking stolen toasters, man.

201
00:10:56.335 --> 00:10:58.995
Yes, yes! This big fucking shit, man.
Philippe Starck, Moschino.

202
00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:00.705
- Fancy shit?
- Yeah, fancy fucking shit.

203
00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.253
- Okay.
- Yeah, Moschino shit, man.

204
00:11:02.335 --> 00:11:03.686
Moschino don't make fucking toasters!

205
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.110
But you're friends with him, right?

206
00:11:05.168 --> 00:11:06.477
We knew each other, we're acquaintances.

207
00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:10.211
Oh, OK. Well, have you heard that this
acquaintance of yours is back in town?

208
00:11:10.293 --> 00:11:11.673
- I heard.
- You did? OK.

209
00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:13.227
So, we've been surveilling
the Webb brothers.

210
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:14.352
Do you know about the Webb brothers?

211
00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:16.061
- Everybody knows the Webb brothers.
- OK. Good, good, good.

212
00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:18.205
Progress already. We're making progress.

213
00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:19.923
OK, so, they're up to something.

214
00:11:20.001 --> 00:11:23.171
You know, like something nefarious.
I mean, so our informants tell us.

215
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:25.269
And where would we be
without our informants, Terry?

216
00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:26.936
- Fucking nowhere.
- Fucking no where's right, dude!

217
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.340
Fucking nowhere, dude!

218
00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:31.751
So Jimmy Harris and the Webbs
are, you know, hooked up.

219
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.960
Ergo...

220
00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:37.003
- Ergo...
- Ergo what, motherfucker?

221
00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:39.285
- Ergo.
- Ergo what? What the fuck is that?

222
00:11:40.293 --> 00:11:41.923
They're planning a fucking robbery.

223
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.041
Bingo!

224
00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:46.336
Keep it down. Keep it down...

225
00:11:47.376 --> 00:11:49.536
And we're gonna fuck 'em up
and you're gonna help us.

226
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.286
What the fuck?

227
00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:52.456
Shit!

228
00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:53.791
Cops.

229
00:11:54.876 --> 00:11:56.706
Oh, shit! Hey, we are the cops!

230
00:11:56.793 --> 00:11:58.793
Motherfuckers!

231
00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:00.876
For a second, I forgot!

232
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.170
You see how I got all like, "Fuck!"

233
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:05.841
I know, but I was there, too.
I was like, "Where, where?"

234
00:12:06.043 --> 00:12:09.093
If I don't help you, what, are you gonna
bust me for possession?

235
00:12:10.168 --> 00:12:11.668
Educated man, Terry! This is...

236
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:14.961
Fuck! This is good coke.

237
00:12:15.043 --> 00:12:17.093
There's a shitload more
where that came from.

238
00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:18.458
Where did you guys get this?

239
00:12:18.543 --> 00:12:20.253
We fucked over a mime.

240
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.170
<i>They're off and running!</i>

241
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.500
Oh, Your Lordship.

242
00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:00.245
She's a three-year-old.

243
00:13:01.168 --> 00:13:02.878
Lovely little filly.

244
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.144
What's she like in the saddle?

245
00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:06.538
I haven't ridden her yet. She's, uh...

246
00:13:06.626 --> 00:13:08.086
She's a little...

247
00:13:08.543 --> 00:13:10.843
Excuse me. One of my trainers.

248
00:13:11.585 --> 00:13:14.705
Do keep me informed of any further
development, won't you?

249
00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:16.383
Of course.

250
00:13:19.793 --> 00:13:21.793
You know, I hate champagne.

251
00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:23.875
Why do I drink it, then?

252
00:13:25.293 --> 00:13:27.843
One of those
unresolved mysteries of life.

253
00:13:31.251 --> 00:13:33.881
How's my crew? Or, how are my crew?

254
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.750
Whichever is grammatically correct.

255
00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:37.245
Well, sir,

256
00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:39.835
the Webbs, um, are just checked in.

257
00:13:40.376 --> 00:13:41.456
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.133
- Mmm-hmm.
- And the other thing?

259
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.340
The other thing.

260
00:13:44.418 --> 00:13:47.958
As you can guess, I imagine,
Reynard wants more money.

261
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.420
Of course he does.

262
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:53.041
- What do you want me to do about him?
- Well...

263
00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:57.916
I want you to pay him.

264
00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:00.128
We'll get the money back.

265
00:14:00.335 --> 00:14:03.745
I'm afraid I'll end up in jail first.

266
00:14:03.835 --> 00:14:04.875
Oh, Russell.

267
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.630
Jail's not too bad.

268
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.000
You know what the worst
thing about jail is?

269
00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:11.665
No, Your Lordship, I do not.

270
00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:13.461
The violent anal sex.

271
00:14:15.043 --> 00:14:17.923
But do you know what the best thing
about jail is, Russell?

272
00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:22.536
The violent anal sex?

273
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.000
You know, you're pretty quick
for an American.

274
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.710
Jimmy used to go out with this dancer,
Jacqueline Hollis.

275
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:44.093
Rumour is he's shacked up with her.

276
00:14:44.168 --> 00:14:45.538
You have an address?

277
00:14:45.626 --> 00:14:51.416
No, but I do know she works
at the, uh, this club, Knockouts. Yeah.

278
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:54.061
Of course, that means you two will
actually have to do, you know,

279
00:14:54.085 --> 00:14:55.125
"Police work".

280
00:14:55.293 --> 00:14:57.102
Now, don't be getting obstreperous
with me, motherfucker.

281
00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:58.526
I'll knock your ass into Indochina.

282
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:00.421
Here we go.

283
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:02.211
What the fuck is that?

284
00:15:02.293 --> 00:15:03.923
Cocksucking Cowboys.

285
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.500
Bollocks are still sore
and I didn't do anything to you.

286
00:15:07.585 --> 00:15:10.205
Well, the world's full
of injustice, pal.

287
00:15:10.293 --> 00:15:12.733
Call Amnesty International
if you wanna do something about it.

288
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.340
<i>Salud.</i>

289
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.535
- Ah.
- Ah!

290
00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:22.036
I thought you guys didn't drink.

291
00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:23.995
- How do you mean?
- Muslims.

292
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.380
I'm a Five Percenter.

293
00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:27.706
Mmm, OK.

294
00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:29.273
Do you know what the fuck that means?

295
00:15:29.335 --> 00:15:30.955
I know what that means.

296
00:15:31.126 --> 00:15:32.746
Do you know this other douchebag?

297
00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:34.205
What am I, Huggy Bear now?

298
00:15:34.293 --> 00:15:35.793
Huggy Bear.

299
00:15:36.793 --> 00:15:37.883
Mmm.

300
00:15:38.335 --> 00:15:40.245
Those fellas in the car

301
00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:42.245
with the white stripe.

302
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.340
Who took these? A fucking epileptic?

303
00:15:45.918 --> 00:15:47.269
No, Robert Mapplethorpe over here.

304
00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:49.053
A little something was
wrong with the, uh...

305
00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:50.166
With the thing?

306
00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:51.341
Yeah, with the thing.

307
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.748
Oh, yeah, the thing can be tricky.

308
00:15:53.835 --> 00:15:55.644
Hey, motherfucker,
I could bust you right now for...

309
00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:57.958
Hey! I got multiple sclerosis, OK?

310
00:15:58.043 --> 00:15:59.423
It helps to relieve the symptoms.

311
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:02.006
You're dyslexic
and you have multiple sclerosis?

312
00:16:02.085 --> 00:16:03.125
Mmm.

313
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:05.631
Yeah, I've had a lot
of hard luck in my life.

314
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.500
You can't even spell sclerosis.

315
00:16:07.668 --> 00:16:09.288
S-C-L-E...

316
00:16:09.376 --> 00:16:10.416
Oh, fuck.

317
00:16:11.418 --> 00:16:12.538
Look, I don't know.

318
00:16:13.543 --> 00:16:15.673
Hey, it's Reynard. Clifford Reynard.

319
00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:17.841
I used to steal cars with him.

320
00:16:17.918 --> 00:16:20.248
I mean, I think he's a driver now.

321
00:16:20.335 --> 00:16:22.375
Well, he's a fucking prick, anyways.

322
00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:24.915
Hey.

323
00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:27.836
I claim my prize.

324
00:16:30.085 --> 00:16:31.835
Thank you.

325
00:16:37.501 --> 00:16:38.671
That's amazing.

326
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:41.001
The flexibility.

327
00:16:54.376 --> 00:16:56.376
You should have seen her
when she was 15.

328
00:16:57.876 --> 00:16:59.286
You guys looking for me?

329
00:16:59.376 --> 00:17:02.836
Well, if you're the manager
of this shithole, then yes, we are.

330
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.670
I'm Detective Bolaño. Detective Monroe.

331
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:10.001
You are...

332
00:17:10.085 --> 00:17:11.415
Russell Birdwell.

333
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.840
What's the problem?

334
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.800
We're looking for the address of
one of your dancers. Jacqueline Hollis?

335
00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:18.586
Jackie Hollis?

336
00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:19.958
Jackie Hollis, whatever.

337
00:17:20.043 --> 00:17:22.503
She doesn't work for me any more,
she quit.

338
00:17:22.585 --> 00:17:25.625
Yeah, I didn't ask you
if she's currently employed here.

339
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.460
I asked you for her address.

340
00:17:27.543 --> 00:17:29.293
She in some kind of trouble?

341
00:17:30.085 --> 00:17:32.375
Just give us her fucking address.

342
00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:34.878
You guys are adorable.

343
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.020
Where are you guys from? What precinct?

344
00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:40.995
We're from hell, baby.

345
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:48.421
You know, the, uh, guy that discovered
Uranus wanted to call it George.

346
00:17:50.085 --> 00:17:52.085
This is the planet George.

347
00:17:52.835 --> 00:17:53.875
Come on, Harris.

348
00:17:55.085 --> 00:17:56.245
Oh!

349
00:18:02.126 --> 00:18:03.666
- What?
- Oh, hey, darling.

350
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.791
Tell Jimmy Harry wants to see him.

351
00:18:06.918 --> 00:18:09.248
- Harry who?
- Harry fucking Krishna!

352
00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:11.455
Get away from the door, ma'am.
Get away from the door.

353
00:18:23.418 --> 00:18:26.628
Hey, it's Manny Pacquiao!

354
00:18:28.085 --> 00:18:29.785
Leave him alone.

355
00:18:30.668 --> 00:18:31.998
He's a Quaker.

356
00:18:32.293 --> 00:18:33.852
Does he have any guns
stashed away anywhere?

357
00:18:33.876 --> 00:18:37.206
No, I told you, he's a Quaker.
He abhors violence.

358
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.540
- He what?
- What?

359
00:18:38.793 --> 00:18:40.793
He abhors violence.

360
00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:44.416
- He abhors!
- Fucking pigs, man!

361
00:18:44.543 --> 00:18:45.633
Hey!

362
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.000
That's not very nice.

363
00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:51.745
Hey, Jackie, can you put on some, uh,
coffee for Mr Harris here?

364
00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:55.335
- And you should probably have one.
- You want some doughnuts, too? Fuckers.

365
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.590
Nice underwear, Jimmy.

366
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:03.131
Ooh! Widescreen.

367
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.340
Cool beans.

368
00:19:06.918 --> 00:19:07.998
You got any Glen Campbell?

369
00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:09.165
Who?

370
00:19:09.251 --> 00:19:10.751
You never heard of Glen Campbell?

371
00:19:14.335 --> 00:19:15.455
What's gonna happen to him?

372
00:19:17.001 --> 00:19:18.041
To Glen Campbell?

373
00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:19.536
To Jimmy.

374
00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:23.206
Guess they'll ship him back to Riker's
with another nickel on his sentence.

375
00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:25.955
There's nothing you can do for him?

376
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.920
Are you trying to bribe us, ma'am?

377
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.750
No.

378
00:19:31.043 --> 00:19:32.543
Damn it!

379
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:35.791
These fucking law-abiding citizens.

380
00:19:37.835 --> 00:19:38.915
Well, how much?

381
00:19:39.335 --> 00:19:40.477
How much you have in the house?

382
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:43.131
Five. Two. Two Gs.

383
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.880
How much you got in the fucking house?

384
00:19:45.376 --> 00:19:46.496
Five.

385
00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:48.245
Great! We'll take it.

386
00:19:48.376 --> 00:19:49.456
And then he's free to walk?

387
00:19:49.543 --> 00:19:52.503
If it's within his capabilities.
And I'm taking that widescreen as well.

388
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.790
You want something?

389
00:19:53.876 --> 00:19:55.206
No, I don't want anything.

390
00:19:58.543 --> 00:20:01.383
So, Jimmy-boy, why are you in town?

391
00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.768
You wouldn't happen to be planning
a little caper, now, would you?

392
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.995
Do you have an Xbox, by any chance?

393
00:20:16.085 --> 00:20:18.245
I can't concentrate. What the fuck?

394
00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:19.498
They were there first.

395
00:20:19.668 --> 00:20:22.418
This is a Soderbergh movie.
It requires focus.

396
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.290
What's a Soderbergh?

397
00:20:24.376 --> 00:20:26.176
Steven Soderbergh
is a Jewish-American auteur.

398
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.290
He's Swedish.

399
00:20:27.376 --> 00:20:29.956
He's in jail now in Florida
on a morals charge.

400
00:20:30.043 --> 00:20:32.133
Jennifer Lopez is in this movie.

401
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.394
Takes her blouse off,
but you can't really see her titties.

402
00:20:34.418 --> 00:20:35.838
Why can't you see her titties?

403
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.381
Because she's a serious fucking actor,
that's why.

404
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.710
She's not gonna get her cupcakes out
for a fool like you.

405
00:20:42.043 --> 00:20:44.133
- César, go get it.
- Go get it, you.

406
00:20:44.335 --> 00:20:46.125
He told you to get it! Mom!

407
00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.130
Stop whining and answer the door, OK?

408
00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.633
Why do you always pick on me?

409
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.950
Because you're the youngest
and most vulnerable, I guess.

410
00:20:56.043 --> 00:20:58.423
That quote is Simone de Beauvoir.

411
00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:01.416
If I could only find the damn thing.

412
00:21:02.043 --> 00:21:03.923
Mmm, 50 bucks coming my way.

413
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:05.091
Don't pay her, Pop.

414
00:21:05.168 --> 00:21:06.498
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

415
00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:09.418
This jackass says you wanted to see him.

416
00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.501
Don't call Reggie a jackass,
that's rude.

417
00:21:11.668 --> 00:21:13.038
And factually inaccurate.

418
00:21:13.543 --> 00:21:15.213
He's more like a pathetic simpleton.

419
00:21:16.293 --> 00:21:17.923
Sit down, Reggie.

420
00:21:25.793 --> 00:21:26.883
So you found Jimmy?

421
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.210
In body, if not in spirit.

422
00:21:28.876 --> 00:21:30.956
Hey, I'm sorry for Terry
making fun of your religion.

423
00:21:32.793 --> 00:21:34.633
I apologise on his behalf.

424
00:21:35.751 --> 00:21:37.291
Jennifer Lopez is in this.

425
00:21:37.585 --> 00:21:39.394
She takes her blouse off
but you can't really see her titties.

426
00:21:39.418 --> 00:21:40.628
I know!

427
00:21:41.585 --> 00:21:43.375
No, stop, Your Lordship!

428
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.750
Stop!

429
00:21:44.835 --> 00:21:45.875
Your father!

430
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.710
I don't give a damn about my father.

431
00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:09.835
Some cops showed up at the club tonight.

432
00:22:09.918 --> 00:22:12.588
Some bullshit about one of my dancers.

433
00:22:12.668 --> 00:22:14.088
Ex-dancer.

434
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.420
Do you think it has anything
to do with us?

435
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:19.501
Maybe, maybe not.

436
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.311
Want me to get in touch with the Webbs,
tell them to cancel the gig?

437
00:22:23.335 --> 00:22:24.745
No.

438
00:22:24.835 --> 00:22:26.785
It's probably just a coincidence, but...

439
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.290
Get hold of the girl.
See what their story is.

440
00:22:31.335 --> 00:22:33.915
Give them a warning, if necessary.

441
00:22:35.626 --> 00:22:38.336
So where's this grand finale
you've been promising me, Russell?

442
00:22:38.918 --> 00:22:40.628
Chill out, maestro.

443
00:22:41.543 --> 00:22:43.213
It's on its way.

444
00:23:40.501 --> 00:23:41.921
A million dollars.

445
00:23:42.793 --> 00:23:44.593
Any questions, gentlemen?

446
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.840
I'm not sure whether that's supreme
self-confidence or idiocy.

447
00:23:49.835 --> 00:23:51.335
But whatever.

448
00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:05.843
Russell?

449
00:24:06.793 --> 00:24:10.293
Do you ever think that you're God
and everything else is just an illusion?

450
00:24:12.168 --> 00:24:13.538
No.

451
00:24:27.668 --> 00:24:28.788
I love cheerleaders.

452
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.460
Is this part of your act?

453
00:24:31.293 --> 00:24:34.133
I'm a majorette, moron.

454
00:24:34.501 --> 00:24:36.541
I love majorettes, too.

455
00:24:36.626 --> 00:24:37.996
I ain't prejudiced.

456
00:24:39.418 --> 00:24:40.588
What do you want?

457
00:24:41.168 --> 00:24:42.458
Brought you a new TV.

458
00:24:43.501 --> 00:24:45.001
Oh.

459
00:24:45.085 --> 00:24:47.125
You have a conscience after all, huh?

460
00:24:49.668 --> 00:24:50.878
Do you want it or not?

461
00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:09.496
<i>♪ I am a lineman for the county... ♪</i>

462
00:25:11.835 --> 00:25:13.285
Weirdo.

463
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.130
You're the weirdo.

464
00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:17.341
You're the weirdo.

465
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.420
Who's this asshole?

466
00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:22.841
Ex-boyfriend.

467
00:25:23.585 --> 00:25:25.455
Looks like a douchebag.

468
00:25:25.543 --> 00:25:27.213
He was a really intelligent guy.

469
00:25:28.335 --> 00:25:31.625
He wrote a well-regarded monograph
on André Breton.

470
00:25:32.585 --> 00:25:33.705
And he had a nice dick.

471
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:38.791
And who's this?

472
00:25:38.876 --> 00:25:39.956
Ex-boyfriend.

473
00:25:41.335 --> 00:25:42.705
Oh, he had a nice dick, too.

474
00:25:47.085 --> 00:25:48.375
What is this about?

475
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.960
I don't know.

476
00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:52.835
Loneliness?

477
00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:54.745
It's kinda creepy.

478
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.250
It's like something bad's gonna happen

479
00:25:59.335 --> 00:26:01.705
but there's nothing she can do about it.

480
00:26:02.293 --> 00:26:03.383
Yeah.

481
00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:12.461
So where did Jimmy-boy
say he was going?

482
00:26:12.543 --> 00:26:14.293
Kenosha.

483
00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:15.536
Kenosha, Wisconsin.

484
00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:17.376
- Kenosha, Wisconsin?
- Mmm-hmm.

485
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.500
Yeah? Right.

486
00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:21.665
He ain't left town.

487
00:26:21.751 --> 00:26:23.251
What makes you so sure?

488
00:26:23.335 --> 00:26:25.375
ESP, darling.

489
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.170
Let's just leave it at that.

490
00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:37.535
So why'd you become a cop?

491
00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:40.751
Your heart doesn't exactly
seem to be in it.

492
00:26:42.918 --> 00:26:45.498
I guess I always wanted to pervert
the course of justice.

493
00:26:46.751 --> 00:26:49.501
Plus you can shoot people for no reason.

494
00:26:49.585 --> 00:26:52.035
Nobody can do a goddamn thing about it.

495
00:27:09.293 --> 00:27:10.593
Any sign of Reynard?

496
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.290
No, he's still in there.

497
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:16.791
What's going on
in the big wide world?

498
00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:19.626
Two hundred people died
in an earthquake in Peru.

499
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.040
Who gives a fuck?

500
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:24.840
Peruvians?

501
00:27:52.168 --> 00:27:53.288
Oof.

502
00:27:53.376 --> 00:27:55.996
That looks nasty.

503
00:27:56.668 --> 00:27:57.748
Are you his wife, ma'am?

504
00:28:02.168 --> 00:28:03.588
Why'd you stick him, ma'am?

505
00:28:04.793 --> 00:28:07.093
Ma'am! Why did you stick him?

506
00:28:13.876 --> 00:28:17.206
Ma'am, that's getting to sound
just a little bit monotonous now.

507
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.290
Ma'am...

508
00:28:24.043 --> 00:28:25.793
Can we play a little game?

509
00:28:25.876 --> 00:28:27.746
Can we play a little game
of Shut The Fuck Up?

510
00:28:34.918 --> 00:28:37.838
Ma'am, did you do those paintings?

511
00:28:38.793 --> 00:28:40.293
He's gone.

512
00:28:40.376 --> 00:28:41.536
So is he.

513
00:28:50.793 --> 00:28:53.673
Yeah, but did you know that
Joseph Conrad and Vincent van Gogh

514
00:28:53.751 --> 00:28:56.501
both tried to kill themselves
by shooting themselves in the heart?

515
00:28:56.585 --> 00:28:58.285
And both missed.

516
00:28:58.918 --> 00:29:00.498
No, it's true.

517
00:29:00.585 --> 00:29:02.585
No, I'm not making this shit up!

518
00:29:02.668 --> 00:29:03.998
Fuck you!

519
00:29:04.085 --> 00:29:06.285
Crime-scene pricks are on their way.

520
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:08.631
She says his name is Danny.

521
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.420
Say anything about Reynard?

522
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:13.019
- Planning a heist or something?
- No, I can barely get a word out of her.

523
00:29:13.043 --> 00:29:14.394
She's still bawling her fucking eyes out.

524
00:29:14.418 --> 00:29:15.458
Shut up!

525
00:29:15.543 --> 00:29:16.686
What are we gonna do about the kid?

526
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.840
I mean, what can we do?

527
00:29:23.293 --> 00:29:24.463
Out.

528
00:29:24.543 --> 00:29:26.043
- Fuck!
- That was out.

529
00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:30.633
Give me a second, sisters.

530
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.790
I'll play.

531
00:29:39.376 --> 00:29:40.456
It's good.

532
00:29:44.085 --> 00:29:45.602
What happened to your nose, sweetheart?

533
00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:47.456
A Chihuahua bit me.

534
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.130
So what's up?

535
00:29:51.126 --> 00:29:53.666
Clifford Reynard shuffled off
this mortal coil.

536
00:29:53.751 --> 00:29:55.501
So what?

537
00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:57.505
So the Webb brothers
are gonna need a new driver.

538
00:29:57.543 --> 00:29:59.003
And soon, probably.

539
00:29:59.085 --> 00:30:00.875
So if you hear of anything...

540
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm familiar with the
whole cop-slash-informant dialectic.

541
00:30:10.793 --> 00:30:12.003
Fucking mishit.

542
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.170
You did not mean that!

543
00:30:16.251 --> 00:30:17.751
Pure luck.

544
00:30:19.626 --> 00:30:21.286
Oh, come on!

545
00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:23.376
No need for a fucking jihad here!

546
00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:27.043
Can't take him anywhere.

547
00:30:30.876 --> 00:30:32.496
My mom died young.

548
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.210
She was an alcoholic.

549
00:30:35.293 --> 00:30:37.003
What about your dad?

550
00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:38.915
I never knew him.

551
00:30:39.001 --> 00:30:40.291
How about you?

552
00:30:42.168 --> 00:30:43.958
He's dead.

553
00:30:44.043 --> 00:30:45.093
How?

554
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.500
Suicide-murder.

555
00:30:49.418 --> 00:30:50.878
Suicide-murder?

556
00:30:52.126 --> 00:30:54.206
Was that, like, some pact thing?

557
00:30:55.335 --> 00:30:57.061
Like he killed your mom
and then offed himself?

558
00:30:57.085 --> 00:30:59.245
No, my mom lives in Tennessee.

559
00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:00.535
So it was another woman?

560
00:31:00.668 --> 00:31:03.208
- Mmm, no.
- Another man?

561
00:31:03.293 --> 00:31:04.503
Yeah.

562
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.630
But not... He wasn't gay or anything.

563
00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:09.708
Well, I don't, I don't get it.

564
00:31:09.793 --> 00:31:11.713
He was a security guard

565
00:31:11.793 --> 00:31:13.883
but he always wanted to be a SWAT guy.

566
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.340
- Why?
- He never made it.

567
00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:17.498
- Why? I don't know.
- They're fucking assholes.

568
00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:19.665
Well, so was he.

569
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:22.091
So one night, he goes into a bar

570
00:31:22.168 --> 00:31:23.878
and he gets to drinking

571
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.670
and he gets more and more depressed

572
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:28.961
and he pulls out his gun
and he blows his brains out.

573
00:31:29.043 --> 00:31:32.043
Unfortunately, there's this guy
sitting next to him.

574
00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:34.246
And the bullet goes through
my dad's head

575
00:31:34.335 --> 00:31:36.245
and hits this other guy in his head...

576
00:31:36.335 --> 00:31:37.455
...and kills him.

577
00:31:37.543 --> 00:31:39.673
- No.
- Yeah.

578
00:31:39.751 --> 00:31:44.671
So the inquest found that
technically, it was a suicide-murder.

579
00:31:46.293 --> 00:31:47.383
Although

580
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.140
if my dad was dead before the bullet hit
this other guy in his head,

581
00:31:50.168 --> 00:31:52.088
was that actually murder?

582
00:31:52.168 --> 00:31:53.708
Philosophically speaking?

583
00:31:54.793 --> 00:31:56.477
That's a very interesting
question, actually.

584
00:31:56.501 --> 00:31:59.091
I'll ask Bob, he'll know.

585
00:31:59.168 --> 00:32:01.168
Let me know what he says.

586
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.130
There's no plot
in these things any more.

587
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:10.921
Just straight in there.

588
00:32:13.793 --> 00:32:15.843
No preamble, no nothing.

589
00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:17.338
Oh, yeah. Take it!

590
00:32:17.418 --> 00:32:19.038
Where's the romance?

591
00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.170
Starts and ends with the script.

592
00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:23.791
You ain't got a good script...

593
00:32:23.876 --> 00:32:25.126
...you ain't got shit.

594
00:32:27.043 --> 00:32:28.163
You guys think you're tough?

595
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.960
You guys think you're so tough, huh?

596
00:32:30.043 --> 00:32:31.253
You think I can't do it?

597
00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:36.415
Oh, God, it's real. It's going off.

598
00:32:36.501 --> 00:32:37.631
Playboy Mansion.

599
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.000
<i>- Hey!</i>
- Stop!

600
00:32:39.835 --> 00:32:42.245
Whatever it is,
it's happening at the mosque downtown,

601
00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:44.205
1:00 pm tomorrow. Don't ask me what.

602
00:32:44.293 --> 00:32:45.343
Who's doing the driving?

603
00:32:45.418 --> 00:32:48.288
The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
How the fuck should I know?

604
00:32:50.876 --> 00:32:52.602
One thing that I forgot
to tell you guys is...

605
00:32:52.626 --> 00:32:53.876
Sha-bam!

606
00:32:56.793 --> 00:32:57.923
How do I look?

607
00:32:58.001 --> 00:32:59.171
Mmm-hmm. Suits you.

608
00:32:59.251 --> 00:33:01.921
Stupid feckin' cops.

609
00:33:27.585 --> 00:33:29.285
You're soaked.

610
00:33:30.668 --> 00:33:32.088
You okay?

611
00:33:34.085 --> 00:33:35.375
Yeah, I'm okay.

612
00:33:36.835 --> 00:33:38.625
Did you have a bad dream?

613
00:33:41.918 --> 00:33:43.378
Go back to sleep, babe.

614
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.540
Hmm.

615
00:35:18.168 --> 00:35:20.248
Yeah, <i>perfecto.</i>

616
00:35:42.418 --> 00:35:44.218
- You know what they say about vertigo?
- Mmm.

617
00:35:44.293 --> 00:35:46.383
The vertigo is not the fear of falling

618
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.460
but the fear of wanting to fall.

619
00:35:54.376 --> 00:35:55.916
Aloha, ladies.

620
00:35:58.126 --> 00:35:59.746
I don't think
this is right, man.

621
00:36:01.043 --> 00:36:03.253
They're not gonna knock over
a fucking mosque.

622
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.340
They'll have ISIS on their asses.

623
00:36:07.126 --> 00:36:08.336
Or al-Qaida.

624
00:36:09.626 --> 00:36:11.206
Hey, is it al-Qaida or al-Qaeda?

625
00:36:11.835 --> 00:36:13.745
You say al-Qaeda, I'll say al-Qaida.

626
00:36:13.835 --> 00:36:16.375
- I say al-Qaida, you say al-Qaeda.
- Al-Qaeda.

627
00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.500
- Al-Qaeda.
- Al-Qaida.

628
00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:20.133
What are you doing?

629
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.340
We're loitering with intent.

630
00:36:21.418 --> 00:36:23.248
What the fuck does it look like
we're doing?

631
00:36:23.335 --> 00:36:24.375
Fuck off.

632
00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.000
- You fuck off.
- No, you fuck off.

633
00:36:26.085 --> 00:36:27.535
- You fuck off.
- No, you fuck off.

634
00:36:27.626 --> 00:36:28.996
- You fuck off.
- Hey! Hey!

635
00:36:29.793 --> 00:36:32.463
You might wanna be a little careful

636
00:36:32.543 --> 00:36:33.686
or you'll wind up
another dead schizophrenic,

637
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.790
you know what I'm saying?

638
00:36:34.876 --> 00:36:36.626
And that bike is way too small for you.

639
00:36:41.376 --> 00:36:43.206
Hey, you don't think Reggie would...

640
00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.590
Oh, fuck!

641
00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:54.995
Should've gone to Wisconsin
and fucked some sheep, Jimmy-boy.

642
00:36:56.668 --> 00:36:58.088
You know him?

643
00:36:58.168 --> 00:36:59.378
Yeah.

644
00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:02.421
James Harris. He's been on the run
these last couple of months.

645
00:37:02.501 --> 00:37:03.751
Apparently, he's a Quaker.

646
00:37:03.835 --> 00:37:05.535
A Quaker?

647
00:37:05.626 --> 00:37:07.036
I thought they abhor violence.

648
00:37:07.668 --> 00:37:09.128
Was it a good shoot or a bad shoot?

649
00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:10.836
Well...

650
00:37:11.585 --> 00:37:14.585
...that's what we would call
a "contentious issue".

651
00:37:14.668 --> 00:37:15.788
Fuck me.

652
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.170
Again, really?
It's like every fucking week.

653
00:37:20.501 --> 00:37:22.541
- At least these guys are white.
- Yeah!

654
00:37:22.626 --> 00:37:24.426
- Yeah. Gotta look at the bright side.
- Yeah.

655
00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:27.883
- What happened to the driver?
- He got away.

656
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.130
Oh. Was he a Latin, Caucasian
or Negro gentleman?

657
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.170
African American, yes.

658
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:35.001
Got away with the money, too.
Close to a mil.

659
00:37:36.251 --> 00:37:37.461
Wait a second.

660
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:39.771
How'd you know the driver was missing?

661
00:37:40.918 --> 00:37:41.958
Wild guess.

662
00:37:42.043 --> 00:37:43.644
- That's a wild guess?
- Wild guess, yeah.

663
00:37:43.668 --> 00:37:44.894
We never said missing.
Nobody ever said missing.

664
00:37:44.918 --> 00:37:46.061
He just said,
"What happened to the driver?"

665
00:37:46.085 --> 00:37:47.565
- He just asked.
- I was just curious.

666
00:37:49.876 --> 00:37:53.206
Reynard gets shanked so he can't drive,
he's dead.

667
00:37:53.293 --> 00:37:55.963
So Jimmy Harris asks his old pal Reggie
to be the driver.

668
00:37:56.043 --> 00:37:59.593
And Reggie,
the double-crossing bastard,

669
00:37:59.668 --> 00:38:01.838
decoys us and skedaddles with the money.

670
00:38:02.626 --> 00:38:03.876
Whose money?

671
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.670
Our money.

672
00:38:19.668 --> 00:38:21.498
Patronising fuck.

673
00:38:23.085 --> 00:38:24.375
Ah...

674
00:38:25.376 --> 00:38:27.166
Well, well, well.

675
00:38:29.001 --> 00:38:30.631
Allah be praised.

676
00:38:41.876 --> 00:38:43.336
What are you thinking?

677
00:38:45.043 --> 00:38:48.043
I'm thinking someone has just made
a very big mistake.

678
00:39:03.043 --> 00:39:05.293
So you heard about Jimmy Harris.

679
00:39:05.918 --> 00:39:08.128
I just lit a candle for him.

680
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.790
That's a very good idea.

681
00:39:09.876 --> 00:39:11.586
He's gonna need all the help he can get.

682
00:39:11.668 --> 00:39:14.088
He wasn't so bad.
He always treated me okay.

683
00:39:15.168 --> 00:39:17.248
He was a Quaker.

684
00:39:17.335 --> 00:39:18.625
They didn't have to kill him.

685
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.880
He would've tried to kill them,
if he had the chance.

686
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.630
Quaker or not.

687
00:39:25.626 --> 00:39:27.536
Tell me about Russell Birdwell.

688
00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:29.591
What's there to tell?

689
00:39:29.668 --> 00:39:31.208
He runs a strip joint.

690
00:39:31.293 --> 00:39:33.883
It's not like he's Diaghilev
with the Ballets Russes.

691
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.340
Come on.

692
00:39:35.418 --> 00:39:37.588
He wanted to know
why you were looking for me.

693
00:39:37.668 --> 00:39:40.418
I told him you weren't looking for me,
you were looking for Jimmy.

694
00:39:40.501 --> 00:39:43.001
That wasn't good enough
for Mr Birdwell, was it?

695
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:45.791
He's a wacko.

696
00:39:45.876 --> 00:39:48.086
I had a run-in with him before.

697
00:39:48.168 --> 00:39:49.998
What about?

698
00:39:50.085 --> 00:39:52.415
He tried to get me to do a porno.

699
00:39:52.501 --> 00:39:54.171
I told him to get lost.

700
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:55.541
He got nasty.

701
00:39:57.835 --> 00:39:59.125
He got nasty?

702
00:40:08.626 --> 00:40:10.496
Okay, <i>mami,</i> I got three dollars!

703
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:21.880
Birdwell!

704
00:40:23.085 --> 00:40:25.165
- Nobody move!
- Move!

705
00:40:27.585 --> 00:40:28.745
Snake!

706
00:40:28.835 --> 00:40:29.875
Oh, fuck!

707
00:40:37.918 --> 00:40:39.878
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

708
00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:01.206
Move!

709
00:41:29.418 --> 00:41:30.788
You're a shit shot, Birdwell.

710
00:41:31.876 --> 00:41:34.556
No one cares about innocent bystanders.
Why do you keep moving, man?

711
00:41:57.043 --> 00:41:58.343
Fuck.

712
00:41:58.918 --> 00:42:01.038
Fuck. Fuck!

713
00:42:01.168 --> 00:42:02.668
Bob, were you hit?

714
00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:04.921
It's just a cramp. A bad one.

715
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:06.841
Go, go.

716
00:42:09.376 --> 00:42:10.996
I'm just gonna breathe.

717
00:42:31.876 --> 00:42:33.086
Come on, little piggy.

718
00:42:33.876 --> 00:42:34.916
Come on!

719
00:42:45.085 --> 00:42:46.915
You see this ring?

720
00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:48.091
My mom gave me this ring.

721
00:42:48.543 --> 00:42:49.593
Ah.

722
00:42:49.668 --> 00:42:51.268
It's a nice ring.
You know what it's for?

723
00:42:58.001 --> 00:43:00.541
It's for beating the shit
out of scumbags like you.

724
00:43:12.085 --> 00:43:13.835
Why don't we just
throw him off the roof?

725
00:43:14.376 --> 00:43:15.706
- Huh?
- I'm kidding. I'm...

726
00:43:16.876 --> 00:43:18.246
It was a bad joke.

727
00:43:18.418 --> 00:43:19.748
Hey, you wanna go grab a burrito?

728
00:43:19.835 --> 00:43:21.955
I can't, it's date night.

729
00:43:22.835 --> 00:43:23.995
Oh.

730
00:43:27.835 --> 00:43:28.955
A million dollars?

731
00:43:29.043 --> 00:43:30.173
It's a nice, round number.

732
00:43:30.251 --> 00:43:31.961
That's my favourite round number.

733
00:43:32.043 --> 00:43:33.923
We don't need a million dollars
to retire.

734
00:43:34.001 --> 00:43:35.041
No?

735
00:43:35.126 --> 00:43:37.376
Not if you're gonna get killed
going after it.

736
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.920
Oh, I can handle myself, baby girl.

737
00:43:39.001 --> 00:43:41.001
Don't you worry your pretty little head
about that.

738
00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.915
- Fuck you.
- And besides,

739
00:43:43.168 --> 00:43:45.408
- fortune favours the bold.
- You know where that's from?

740
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.340
- Greek mythology.
- Oh.

741
00:43:47.418 --> 00:43:50.288
A guy named Turnus said it
just before another guy

742
00:43:50.376 --> 00:43:52.206
named Aeneas

743
00:43:52.293 --> 00:43:54.423
popped a cap in his ass.

744
00:43:54.585 --> 00:43:55.769
It's just like my mother said.

745
00:43:55.793 --> 00:43:58.463
You're too damn smart
for your own damn good.

746
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:01.211
One second.

747
00:44:01.293 --> 00:44:02.713
Hey, assfuck!

748
00:44:04.835 --> 00:44:06.165
Did you shit in this?

749
00:44:13.543 --> 00:44:15.293
Whoa, there, pilgrim.

750
00:44:17.293 --> 00:44:18.503
This is lush.

751
00:44:20.251 --> 00:44:21.421
Yeah, it's all right.

752
00:44:23.085 --> 00:44:25.205
Don't be getting any ideas, though.

753
00:44:25.293 --> 00:44:28.963
This is just till this bullshit
with Birdwell blows over.

754
00:44:34.876 --> 00:44:36.626
How can you afford this place?

755
00:44:37.126 --> 00:44:38.376
Overtime.

756
00:45:59.751 --> 00:46:01.091
Where's Reggie?

757
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:03.250
Why the fuck would I tell you?

758
00:46:03.335 --> 00:46:05.915
Well, we know that Reggie was
the driver for the racetrack heist.

759
00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:07.091
Where is he?

760
00:46:07.168 --> 00:46:08.958
You're making me repeat meself now.

761
00:46:09.168 --> 00:46:10.878
Why the fuck would I...

762
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.750
All right, don't fucking hit me!

763
00:46:12.835 --> 00:46:14.035
I'm an only child.

764
00:46:14.126 --> 00:46:15.206
He got away with the money.

765
00:46:15.793 --> 00:46:16.883
How much?

766
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.040
Million bucks.

767
00:46:18.918 --> 00:46:20.498
- Fuck me.
- Yep.

768
00:46:20.585 --> 00:46:21.915
A million?

769
00:46:24.126 --> 00:46:26.586
- How much do I get if I...
- Rat out your friend?

770
00:46:26.793 --> 00:46:27.883
Yeah.

771
00:46:29.168 --> 00:46:31.168
- 50.
- 200.

772
00:46:31.335 --> 00:46:33.165
- 50.
- 175.

773
00:46:33.251 --> 00:46:34.921
- 50.
- 100.

774
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:36.750
All right, 50.

775
00:46:37.668 --> 00:46:38.708
Where is he?

776
00:46:38.793 --> 00:46:41.003
You're not gonna believe this, lads.

777
00:46:42.418 --> 00:46:43.628
Fucking Iceland.

778
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.394
Well, they have something
called the Blue Lagoon here.

779
00:47:03.418 --> 00:47:04.838
It's a hotspot.

780
00:47:04.918 --> 00:47:06.088
It's outdoors.

781
00:47:07.251 --> 00:47:10.001
It's probably full of sweaty Europeans
with bad teeth,

782
00:47:10.085 --> 00:47:11.585
fucking each other.

783
00:47:12.918 --> 00:47:14.628
You'd be swimming around in jizz.

784
00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:18.668
European jizz.

785
00:47:21.501 --> 00:47:23.541
It was one of the first movies
I ever saw, actually.

786
00:47:23.626 --> 00:47:25.036
<i>European Jizz?</i>

787
00:47:25.126 --> 00:47:26.746
<i>- The Blue Lagoon.</i>
- Oh, right.

788
00:47:27.293 --> 00:47:30.043
Either that or
<i>Doc Savage: Man of Bronze.</i>

789
00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.210
Oh, fuck.

790
00:47:42.085 --> 00:47:43.205
Hey, Bob.

791
00:47:43.376 --> 00:47:44.456
Yeah.

792
00:47:45.126 --> 00:47:47.086
What's the plan for finding Reggie?

793
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.250
It's gonna be tough tracking him down
without anything to go on.

794
00:47:52.418 --> 00:47:53.878
Isn't it?

795
00:47:54.335 --> 00:47:55.785
Well, he's black.

796
00:47:55.876 --> 00:47:58.456
How many fucking black people
do you think there are in Iceland?

797
00:47:58.543 --> 00:48:01.673
We just stand around here
and keep our eyes open.

798
00:48:02.543 --> 00:48:05.343
That's not much of a plan, Bob.
You don't think we should try...

799
00:48:05.418 --> 00:48:06.628
There he is.

800
00:48:43.835 --> 00:48:46.085
I'm a black belt in jiu jitsu,
motherfuckers!

801
00:48:50.293 --> 00:48:52.633
You don't put up much
of a fight, do you?

802
00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:55.091
Fucking Stephen Hawking
could knock you out.

803
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:56.710
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

804
00:48:57.001 --> 00:48:58.381
Well, you kinda have to be.

805
00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.860
I guess I should count myself lucky

806
00:48:59.918 --> 00:49:01.602
you didn't put me in a fucking
chokehold or some shit.

807
00:49:01.626 --> 00:49:02.996
Shut up, shut up.

808
00:49:03.585 --> 00:49:05.335
So, Iceland. What the fuck?

809
00:49:05.668 --> 00:49:07.628
- I wasn't thinking straight.
- No shit.

810
00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:08.961
I panicked, okay?

811
00:49:09.043 --> 00:49:11.593
You would too if you saw
everyone around you getting popped.

812
00:49:11.668 --> 00:49:13.019
That shit was stone-cold murder, man.

813
00:49:13.043 --> 00:49:14.602
Jimmy and the guys
were giving themselves up.

814
00:49:14.626 --> 00:49:17.036
Oh, don't look at me.
I fucking hate murder.

815
00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:18.706
- Don't I, Terry?
- He hates murder.

816
00:49:18.793 --> 00:49:20.293
Oh, I hate murder!

817
00:49:20.585 --> 00:49:21.995
It really upsets me.

818
00:49:22.085 --> 00:49:23.561
But more importantly, where's the loot?

819
00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:24.915
Stashed it.

820
00:49:26.293 --> 00:49:27.383
How much you want?

821
00:49:27.793 --> 00:49:29.753
- All of it.
- Obviously.

822
00:49:29.835 --> 00:49:32.785
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you, glass-jaw boy.

823
00:49:33.293 --> 00:49:35.133
You're gonna hand over
that million bucks or...

824
00:49:37.085 --> 00:49:39.455
- A million bucks?
- Yeah, a million bucks.

825
00:49:40.085 --> 00:49:42.875
I don't have a fucking million bucks,
are you crazy?

826
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:45.686
You fucking cheapskate! You walked away
with a million fucking dollars!

827
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:46.840
It wasn't all mine!

828
00:49:46.918 --> 00:49:49.436
I had to give it to the cat who planned
the whole thing, then I got my cut.

829
00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.210
Oh, now you're bullshitting us.

830
00:49:51.293 --> 00:49:53.923
Either the Webb brothers planned it
or Jimmy Harris planned it

831
00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:55.341
and they're all fucking dead.

832
00:49:55.418 --> 00:49:57.498
Jimmy and the Webb brothers
were tapped out.

833
00:49:57.585 --> 00:49:59.705
That's why they took the gig
in the first place.

834
00:49:59.793 --> 00:50:02.593
The whole thing was planned
by this money guy,

835
00:50:02.668 --> 00:50:04.498
a British dude named James Mangan.

836
00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:05.665
Mmm.

837
00:50:05.751 --> 00:50:07.711
Never heard of him.
Where can we find him?

838
00:50:07.793 --> 00:50:09.133
I don't know where he lives.

839
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.130
He's this mysterious character.

840
00:50:11.376 --> 00:50:14.036
I know he's got
some legit businesses, but...

841
00:50:14.126 --> 00:50:15.727
Look, I'll tell you guys
everything I know

842
00:50:15.751 --> 00:50:17.461
but you gotta give me
a little leeway here.

843
00:50:17.626 --> 00:50:18.706
How much do you have?

844
00:50:18.793 --> 00:50:19.883
200.

845
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.227
- We'll take a hundred.
- Fuck you.

846
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.341
It's hard but it's fair.

847
00:50:22.418 --> 00:50:23.918
It is pretty fair, yeah.

848
00:50:26.751 --> 00:50:27.921
Fine.

849
00:50:31.168 --> 00:50:32.248
Mmm.

850
00:50:32.668 --> 00:50:33.868
How are you finding the place?

851
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.340
Not exactly the best place to blend in

852
00:50:37.376 --> 00:50:39.666
but upside is
I think I'm falling in love.

853
00:50:41.626 --> 00:50:43.166
Baby, where have you been?

854
00:50:53.668 --> 00:50:55.038
You guys want a drink?

855
00:50:57.293 --> 00:50:59.503
I got some pretty good whisky.

856
00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:00.880
I'm good.

857
00:51:01.001 --> 00:51:02.561
I'll try a little bit
of that whisky, Kimberly.

858
00:51:02.585 --> 00:51:04.165
So how long have you known Reggie?

859
00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:06.291
- We're old pals.
- And you're here on holiday?

860
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:08.791
No, just a quick in and out.

861
00:51:09.001 --> 00:51:10.881
- You're together?
- Yes, we are.

862
00:51:11.626 --> 00:51:14.666
No, Kimberly, we are not together.
I'm a heterosexual man.

863
00:51:14.793 --> 00:51:16.463
He's also a heterosexual man.

864
00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:18.631
Well, good for you, honey.

865
00:51:19.585 --> 00:51:21.535
You know, you should go
to the Blue Lagoon.

866
00:51:21.626 --> 00:51:23.496
It's very refreshing.

867
00:51:23.585 --> 00:51:24.665
I'm sure it is.

868
00:51:24.751 --> 00:51:26.041
I go there a lot.

869
00:51:26.126 --> 00:51:27.206
I'm sure you do.

870
00:51:29.335 --> 00:51:30.665
I hope you choke on it.

871
00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.496
So Reggie is gay, huh?

872
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:42.420
If Kimberly has a dick,
which I'm assuming she does,

873
00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:45.171
then that would make Reggie gay, yes.

874
00:51:45.251 --> 00:51:46.631
Possibly bisexual.

875
00:51:46.793 --> 00:51:49.633
Well, what if Kimberly doesn't have...
Like, if she's already...

876
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:50.960
- Post-op?
- Yeah.

877
00:51:51.043 --> 00:51:52.463
That's a good question.

878
00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:56.093
That would make Kimberly a woman,
which would make Reggie straight.

879
00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.920
- Would it?
- With an asterisk.

880
00:51:59.293 --> 00:52:02.003
- But if Reggie is gay...
- Mmm-hmm?

881
00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:05.415
...do you think
Reggie and Pádraic, they...

882
00:52:06.543 --> 00:52:08.923
What the fuck is that,
the international symbol for sodomy?

883
00:52:09.001 --> 00:52:11.251
You know exactly what this is.

884
00:52:34.085 --> 00:52:36.366
You know, I don't think you're allowed
to do that in here.

885
00:52:38.543 --> 00:52:41.753
In fact, I don't think you're allowed
to do that anywhere.

886
00:52:41.835 --> 00:52:44.205
I've just realised
what you remind me of, Russell.

887
00:52:45.751 --> 00:52:47.541
A bloody Cyclops.

888
00:52:47.626 --> 00:52:49.666
I don't know what that means
and you know I don't.

889
00:52:49.751 --> 00:52:52.041
You never read the <i>Odyssey</i>
at school, Russell?

890
00:52:52.793 --> 00:52:54.423
You do surprise me.

891
00:52:55.126 --> 00:52:56.456
I read it in the original Greek

892
00:52:56.543 --> 00:52:58.943
when I was travelling through
the Peloponnese with my father.

893
00:52:59.668 --> 00:53:01.748
I lost my fucking eye!

894
00:53:01.835 --> 00:53:03.375
Calm down.

895
00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.210
You still have one good one.

896
00:53:08.293 --> 00:53:10.503
I'm gonna fuck over
those fucking assholes...

897
00:53:10.585 --> 00:53:12.436
No, you're not.
You're not gonna fuck over anyone.

898
00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.710
They're still policemen, after all.

899
00:53:15.501 --> 00:53:17.171
I don't wanna get into

900
00:53:17.251 --> 00:53:21.091
some kinda fucking contretemps
with you, Your Lordship,

901
00:53:21.168 --> 00:53:23.378
especially not in my condition.

902
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.590
But I do believe
you're being overly cautious.

903
00:53:25.751 --> 00:53:29.131
Do you know who the greatest criminal
that ever lived is?

904
00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:35.085
- No, I don't know.
- No, you don't.

905
00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.500
Because if you did,

906
00:53:37.585 --> 00:53:40.125
he wouldn't be the greatest criminal

907
00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.920
that ever fucking lived, now,
would he? Hmm?

908
00:53:43.001 --> 00:53:45.711
Fuck, man,
that's just the crack talking.

909
00:53:46.585 --> 00:53:49.745
But to put your mind at ease,
I shall have a word with them.

910
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:53.251
Give them a little reducer,

911
00:53:53.335 --> 00:53:54.835
as we say in good old England.

912
00:53:55.293 --> 00:53:56.423
Yeah?

913
00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.130
What if it doesn't take?

914
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.290
Eat your grapes, Russell.

915
00:54:03.501 --> 00:54:05.091
Eat your grapes.

916
00:54:19.626 --> 00:54:21.206
You shot his fucking nuts off.

917
00:54:21.293 --> 00:54:24.463
You shoot a guy in the <i>cojones,</i>
Bob, that shitbird's going down.

918
00:54:24.543 --> 00:54:26.519
Who makes these things, anyway?
They're kinda racist.

919
00:54:26.543 --> 00:54:27.673
Looks like Reggie.

920
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:28.841
Hey!

921
00:54:30.001 --> 00:54:31.421
Where the hell have you two been?

922
00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:32.631
Following up on a tip-off.

923
00:54:32.876 --> 00:54:34.376
To where, fucking Iceland?

924
00:54:36.626 --> 00:54:39.416
- No, we were in Iceland!
- Yeah.

925
00:54:39.668 --> 00:54:41.378
Bob, that shit's not funny any more.

926
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.880
Not that it was funny to begin with,
so I don't even know why I said that.

927
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.000
Anyway, during your unexplained absence,

928
00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:51.710
I received a very serious
allegation of assault.

929
00:54:51.793 --> 00:54:53.633
This Russell Birdwell character.

930
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.170
- Fuck him!
- No, Terry!

931
00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:56.711
Fuck you!

932
00:54:56.793 --> 00:55:00.593
How many times do I have to tell you?

933
00:55:00.668 --> 00:55:03.668
His lawyer is threatening to have you
arraigned on attempted murder charges.

934
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:06.341
Murder charges? He was shooting at us,
for Christ's sake!

935
00:55:06.418 --> 00:55:07.838
I gave him a couple of slaps.

936
00:55:07.918 --> 00:55:09.628
- Oh.
- That's it. Fucking pussy.

937
00:55:09.751 --> 00:55:10.881
Well, he claims

938
00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.750
you failed to identify yourselves
as police officers,

939
00:55:13.835 --> 00:55:16.285
which is why he fled the scene.

940
00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.380
Those are what we call
mitigating circumstances.

941
00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.290
The fact that you knocked out
one of his eyes

942
00:55:22.376 --> 00:55:23.916
while beating him to a pulp,

943
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:28.091
those are not what we call
mitigating circumstances<i>. Capisce?</i>

944
00:55:28.293 --> 00:55:30.923
I told you, Birdwell's part
of an ongoing investigation.

945
00:55:31.001 --> 00:55:32.671
We're gonna get it cleared up
in two days.

946
00:55:32.751 --> 00:55:36.751
Well, you'd better,
cos this shit's not going away.

947
00:55:36.835 --> 00:55:38.227
Meanwhile, I had to release the prick,

948
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:40.251
- pending further investigation.
- Oh, fuck me!

949
00:55:40.335 --> 00:55:44.245
And I have had the hard word
from the powers that be.

950
00:55:44.335 --> 00:55:46.125
So, do me a favour, fellas,

951
00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:49.340
slowly, slowly catchee monkey.
You got it?

952
00:55:49.501 --> 00:55:50.671
Got it.

953
00:56:01.835 --> 00:56:03.125
Hey, shorty.

954
00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:04.673
Where can we find James Mangan?

955
00:56:05.043 --> 00:56:06.543
Get the hell off this property!

956
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.290
Get off this property!

957
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.750
Get off this property!

958
00:56:13.751 --> 00:56:15.211
What are you doing?

959
00:56:19.126 --> 00:56:20.206
Oh, no, no, no!

960
00:56:20.293 --> 00:56:21.843
Get back here, you little bastard!

961
00:56:21.918 --> 00:56:22.998
Help!

962
00:56:27.293 --> 00:56:30.633
He only comes up on weekends
to look over his horses.

963
00:56:31.126 --> 00:56:33.206
He lives... He lives in town.

964
00:56:33.543 --> 00:56:35.793
- Where in town?
- I don't know.

965
00:56:41.626 --> 00:56:42.786
I don't know!

966
00:56:42.876 --> 00:56:43.996
I swear to God!

967
00:56:44.085 --> 00:56:45.875
I swear...

968
00:56:46.168 --> 00:56:48.378
Give me back my fucking wig.

969
00:56:50.043 --> 00:56:51.543
Give me back my fucking wig!

970
00:56:51.626 --> 00:56:53.956
- Put the wig on, put the wig on.
- Sorry, man, I didn't...

971
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:55.894
I didn't mean to upset you
like that, man.

972
00:56:55.918 --> 00:56:57.338
You destroy!

973
00:56:57.418 --> 00:56:58.958
No, it's fine, it's fine.

974
00:56:59.043 --> 00:57:00.173
You destroy!

975
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:02.631
No, it's great. Oh, my God. It looks...

976
00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.090
No! No!

977
00:57:06.168 --> 00:57:07.668
You take it!

978
00:57:13.793 --> 00:57:14.883
Jesus Christ, kid.

979
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.644
With all that time in hand, you'd think
you'd do a better job than this.

980
00:57:17.668 --> 00:57:20.038
It's "homeless", not "homles."

981
00:57:20.335 --> 00:57:21.995
You started with
the letters too big here,

982
00:57:22.085 --> 00:57:23.765
then you had to scrunch them up
at the end.

983
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.380
It's bad presentation.

984
00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:26.540
That's why you're broke.

985
00:57:26.668 --> 00:57:27.958
It's a lazy piece of work.

986
00:57:28.376 --> 00:57:29.536
Come on. Leave him alone.

987
00:57:29.876 --> 00:57:30.956
Thank you.

988
00:57:32.376 --> 00:57:34.036
Getting soft in your old age?

989
00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.920
You need a hug?

990
00:57:37.543 --> 00:57:38.633
There's no Glen Campbell.

991
00:57:38.876 --> 00:57:40.286
Unbelievable.

992
00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.710
Put on some Elvis,
I'm sure they got some Elvis.

993
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.790
You know he died on the can?

994
00:57:44.918 --> 00:57:47.088
Him and Judy Garland.

995
00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:49.708
- What were they doing on...
- Not at the same time.

996
00:57:50.251 --> 00:57:51.341
Oh.

997
00:57:56.543 --> 00:57:57.633
What?

998
00:57:57.835 --> 00:57:59.245
Hey, kid!

999
00:58:00.293 --> 00:58:01.727
- Get off me!
- No, no, I'm not gonna hurt you!

1000
00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:03.671
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1001
00:58:05.335 --> 00:58:06.415
Gotcha.

1002
00:58:07.043 --> 00:58:08.543
Is my mom in jail?

1003
00:58:08.626 --> 00:58:10.336
Yeah, for killing your dad.

1004
00:58:10.501 --> 00:58:12.291
She's not at the beach.

1005
00:58:13.626 --> 00:58:14.836
What?

1006
00:58:15.001 --> 00:58:16.501
Are you gonna arrest me, too?

1007
00:58:16.585 --> 00:58:19.375
No, why would we?
Are you, like, a little gangster?

1008
00:58:19.918 --> 00:58:21.748
You look like you're in a band.

1009
00:58:21.835 --> 00:58:23.165
Why did she kill him?

1010
00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:26.343
Why did your mom kill your dad?

1011
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.380
It's all right, man.
We're the good guys.

1012
00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.130
- Yeah, we're the good guys.
- You can talk to us.

1013
00:58:36.793 --> 00:58:37.883
What are we gonna do?

1014
00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.394
Well, we gotta call Social Services.

1015
00:58:39.418 --> 00:58:40.498
- Social Services?
- Yeah.

1016
00:58:40.585 --> 00:58:42.311
Might as well sell him
to the fucking Philippines.

1017
00:58:42.335 --> 00:58:43.815
What, you wanna adopt a "homles" kid?

1018
00:58:45.043 --> 00:58:46.293
- No!
- Yeah, I can do that.

1019
00:58:46.376 --> 00:58:48.876
- No!
- I'm not putting him back on the street.

1020
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.640
Do you think it's easy
looking after a kid?

1021
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.090
I got two of 'em and it's not easy,
let me tell you.

1022
00:58:53.168 --> 00:58:56.588
I mean, yeah, okay, I love 'em
but I gotta feed them 24 hours a day.

1023
00:58:56.668 --> 00:58:59.338
Those little fat fucks...
It's hard work.

1024
00:58:59.418 --> 00:59:00.878
So you're saying I'm not up to it?

1025
00:59:01.376 --> 00:59:02.876
Yes. That's what I'm saying.

1026
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.960
Just give me a chance, man.

1027
00:59:08.793 --> 00:59:10.383
Just give me a chance, okay?

1028
00:59:11.001 --> 00:59:12.251
No.

1029
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.420
- What in the hell, Terry?
- I'm working on a case, babe,

1030
00:59:18.168 --> 00:59:20.208
and Danny here is the star witness.

1031
00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:24.170
Kinda like in that movie, you know?

1032
00:59:24.251 --> 00:59:25.671
With that kid who died.

1033
00:59:25.751 --> 00:59:28.541
No, what movie? What kid who died?

1034
00:59:28.626 --> 00:59:30.416
Ah, I can't remember.

1035
00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:33.019
Your memory's shot to hell with
all that liquor, you know that, right?

1036
00:59:33.043 --> 00:59:34.673
Yes, I do know that.

1037
00:59:36.293 --> 00:59:39.133
It's one of the few things in life
I have to be thankful for.

1038
00:59:40.418 --> 00:59:43.061
You can just throw your stuff
in one of the spare rooms if you want.

1039
00:59:43.085 --> 00:59:44.665
There's a good kid.

1040
00:59:45.751 --> 00:59:48.131
- Had anything to eat?
- Yes, ma'am.

1041
00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:51.250
Okay, well, get cleaned up.
I'll bring you in some towels.

1042
00:59:53.126 --> 00:59:55.786
Dolores got you hooked
on her feminist crap, huh?

1043
00:59:56.293 --> 00:59:59.173
Hey, can you be a feminist
and still wear hotpants?

1044
01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:01.501
Yes, you can.

1045
01:00:01.668 --> 01:00:02.748
Whoo!

1046
01:00:03.668 --> 01:00:05.128
Don't be such a misogynist.

1047
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.290
Huh?

1048
01:00:06.376 --> 01:00:07.916
And don't change the subject.

1049
01:00:08.626 --> 01:00:10.306
How long is he supposed
to be staying here?

1050
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.602
I don't know, how long are you
supposed to be staying here?

1051
01:00:13.626 --> 01:00:16.086
That's not fair. I was in trouble.

1052
01:00:16.168 --> 01:00:17.998
Well, so is he, babe.

1053
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.670
We're just your ordinary,
everyday nuclear family.

1054
01:00:36.876 --> 01:00:37.956
Hey!

1055
01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.745
Members only.

1056
01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.000
What the fuck does that say?

1057
01:00:44.918 --> 01:00:46.168
It says you're a member.

1058
01:00:47.168 --> 01:00:48.788
Damn right it does, baby.

1059
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:58.250
I want another shot!

1060
01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:01.751
Yo, whoa! Watch out, man!

1061
01:01:02.168 --> 01:01:04.708
Jimmy, can you grab me a drink?

1062
01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:10.168
Hey, I think John's coming tonight!

1063
01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:11.961
- Yeah! Whoo!
- What?

1064
01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.477
Oh, my gosh, I thought
you broke up with him.

1065
01:01:13.501 --> 01:01:14.841
Excuse me!

1066
01:01:14.918 --> 01:01:16.998
Where will I find James Mangan?

1067
01:01:17.085 --> 01:01:18.665
What? How should I know?

1068
01:01:18.751 --> 01:01:20.711
I mean, where does he live?

1069
01:01:20.793 --> 01:01:23.043
Allow me to reiterate.
How should I know?

1070
01:01:23.126 --> 01:01:24.536
Well, he owns this joint, don't he?

1071
01:01:24.626 --> 01:01:26.836
Yeah, so? That don't mean
I know where he lives.

1072
01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:28.631
Well, how often does he come in?

1073
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:30.290
Every now and again.

1074
01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:32.336
You gonna order a drink or what?

1075
01:01:32.418 --> 01:01:33.748
Yeah, I'm gonna order a drink.

1076
01:01:33.835 --> 01:01:35.335
I want a Bloody Mary.

1077
01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.380
The bloodier the better.

1078
01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.590
You got it.

1079
01:01:51.335 --> 01:01:52.415
Are you fucking serious?

1080
01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:54.061
I'm sorry, you can't come
in here looking like that.

1081
01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:55.352
- For fuck's sake.
- You can't come in here wearing...

1082
01:01:55.376 --> 01:01:56.519
See the fucking man over there?

1083
01:01:56.543 --> 01:01:58.644
He's a fucking policeman,
he'll kick the shit out of you.

1084
01:01:58.668 --> 01:02:00.208
- Fine, go. Go!
- See?

1085
01:02:00.293 --> 01:02:01.753
Fuck you, Jeeves.

1086
01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:06.381
Hey, hey!

1087
01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.500
I'd say Iceland
paid off handsomely, huh?

1088
01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:09.945
No, there's only 10 grand in here.

1089
01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.423
We agreed 50.

1090
01:02:11.501 --> 01:02:14.541
Reggie had to pay off
a bigshot named James Mangan.

1091
01:02:14.626 --> 01:02:15.996
James Mangan?

1092
01:02:16.085 --> 01:02:17.205
- You know him?
- Yeah, yeah.

1093
01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:19.227
I sold him some merchandise
a while back. You see him at the fights.

1094
01:02:19.251 --> 01:02:21.341
- He manages a couple of welterweights.
- Yeah.

1095
01:02:21.418 --> 01:02:23.338
He owns the restaurant in this hotel.

1096
01:02:23.418 --> 01:02:24.628
Really?

1097
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:25.840
Must be loaded.

1098
01:02:25.918 --> 01:02:27.598
Yeah. You wanna see
the rest of your money?

1099
01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:29.246
Fucking here we go.

1100
01:02:29.335 --> 01:02:32.096
All right. Just hang out here and
if you see him, just give me a call.

1101
01:02:32.585 --> 01:02:33.835
Okay.

1102
01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:36.883
Still, though, happy days.

1103
01:02:37.876 --> 01:02:39.286
You're not really happy.

1104
01:02:39.376 --> 01:02:41.376
It's just a chemical secretion
in your brain.

1105
01:03:57.918 --> 01:03:58.998
Hey.

1106
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.380
It's me, honey.

1107
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:03.290
It's only me.

1108
01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.213
It's just a dream.

1109
01:04:09.668 --> 01:04:10.748
Okay?

1110
01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.498
It's only a dream.

1111
01:04:29.251 --> 01:04:30.381
What the fuck is that?

1112
01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:33.351
It's a large Chinese plastic cat.
What the fuck does it look like?

1113
01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.780
It's supposed to bring good luck.

1114
01:04:42.793 --> 01:04:44.003
Or maybe not.

1115
01:04:55.668 --> 01:04:56.748
Ah!

1116
01:05:10.585 --> 01:05:11.785
Is that it?

1117
01:05:13.626 --> 01:05:15.166
Is that all you got?

1118
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.500
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that, boys.

1119
01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:23.416
It can get a lot worse, faggot.
Believe me.

1120
01:05:30.418 --> 01:05:32.168
Oh, it can, huh, can it?

1121
01:05:33.543 --> 01:05:35.173
It can get a lot worse, huh?

1122
01:05:37.043 --> 01:05:38.593
Well, what are you gonna do?

1123
01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.458
Huh?

1124
01:05:40.543 --> 01:05:42.093
You gonna cut me?

1125
01:05:43.418 --> 01:05:45.088
You gonna abuse me?

1126
01:05:46.168 --> 01:05:48.248
You gonna rape me?

1127
01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:49.415
Huh?

1128
01:05:53.751 --> 01:05:56.421
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, boys.

1129
01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:01.170
There ain't nothing you can do to me
that ain't already been done.

1130
01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:04.746
So go ahead.

1131
01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:09.381
Do your worst.

1132
01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:14.205
What do you want us to do?

1133
01:06:30.335 --> 01:06:33.245
I don't think the boys will be too keen
on killing a cop.

1134
01:06:35.293 --> 01:06:36.503
Boss.

1135
01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:40.630
Boss!

1136
01:07:32.543 --> 01:07:33.633
Hey.

1137
01:07:35.001 --> 01:07:36.541
Son of a bitch.

1138
01:07:37.251 --> 01:07:39.041
Well, you should see the other guy.

1139
01:07:40.418 --> 01:07:42.418
He's totally unscathed.

1140
01:07:52.585 --> 01:07:54.205
Babe, come on.

1141
01:07:56.043 --> 01:07:57.343
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1142
01:07:58.126 --> 01:07:59.626
I'm okay.

1143
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:01.790
It looks much worse than it is.

1144
01:08:01.876 --> 01:08:03.086
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1145
01:08:03.168 --> 01:08:05.998
Don't cry. Don't cry.
No, no, no, don't cry. I'm okay.

1146
01:08:06.793 --> 01:08:09.253
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

1147
01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.995
Kiss my bloody lips.

1148
01:08:13.418 --> 01:08:15.208
It's gotta be Mangan, right?

1149
01:08:15.293 --> 01:08:17.133
Obviously someone we've upset.

1150
01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:20.250
That could be anybody.

1151
01:08:23.626 --> 01:08:25.706
You look like Adam Ant.

1152
01:08:25.793 --> 01:08:26.883
Remember him?

1153
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.090
Fuck you, hippie.

1154
01:08:28.168 --> 01:08:30.008
Aren't you supposed to be
scoping out the Brit?

1155
01:08:30.043 --> 01:08:31.753
Hmm. They threw me out
when I skinned up.

1156
01:08:31.835 --> 01:08:33.585
He's still in there, though.

1157
01:08:33.668 --> 01:08:35.838
Probably having
a nice little entrée for himself.

1158
01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.420
Nice piece of salmon.

1159
01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:41.841
- Mangan, any distinguishing features?
- Uh...

1160
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:44.790
Yeah, he's sitting with a bunch of Japs.

1161
01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:46.166
<i>Can't miss him.</i>

1162
01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:51.340
James! James.

1163
01:08:52.043 --> 01:08:53.923
Right here. There you are.

1164
01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:55.421
He's right there.

1165
01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.170
Hey!

1166
01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:59.710
How are things, man?

1167
01:09:07.126 --> 01:09:08.876
Well, this is awkward.

1168
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.210
You're not gonna introduce us
to your guy?

1169
01:09:12.335 --> 01:09:13.875
This is Mr Okuyama.

1170
01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:17.291
And Mr Murakawa.
They are business associates of mine.

1171
01:09:17.376 --> 01:09:19.836
This is Miss Ito, their interpreter.

1172
01:09:20.293 --> 01:09:21.713
Mr Bolaño

1173
01:09:22.835 --> 01:09:24.665
and Mr Monroe.

1174
01:09:24.751 --> 01:09:26.251
They're policemen.

1175
01:09:26.335 --> 01:09:27.745
Why is this so formal, huh?

1176
01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:30.955
I'm Bob, this is Terry.
Pleased to meet you.

1177
01:09:31.043 --> 01:09:33.227
- See, that was easier. See?
- Is that lobster? Mind if I...

1178
01:09:33.251 --> 01:09:35.041
That was much easier.

1179
01:09:35.126 --> 01:09:37.046
Oh, I love lobster.
What have you got there, Bob?

1180
01:09:41.543 --> 01:09:43.543
I think it's veal. Yum-yum!

1181
01:09:43.668 --> 01:09:45.208
Would you care for some wine, perhaps?

1182
01:09:45.335 --> 01:09:48.285
No, we can't drink while we're on duty

1183
01:09:48.376 --> 01:09:50.666
because that would be illegal.

1184
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.120
Is everything all right, sir?

1185
01:09:53.418 --> 01:09:55.418
Yes, it's fine.
I'd like the bill, please.

1186
01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:57.961
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- That's good. Hey, Bob.

1187
01:09:58.043 --> 01:10:00.519
Did I ever tell you about that time
I puked Indian food through my nose?

1188
01:10:00.543 --> 01:10:02.213
- No!
- Gentlemen,

1189
01:10:02.293 --> 01:10:05.843
is this a social visit or do you have
a particular reason for embarrassing me?

1190
01:10:05.918 --> 01:10:07.352
We're not trying to embarrass you.
Are we, Terry?

1191
01:10:07.376 --> 01:10:10.036
- Why would we?
- We just came here to say that

1192
01:10:10.126 --> 01:10:12.456
we know everything about you
and we're onto you.

1193
01:10:12.543 --> 01:10:13.727
You don't know
the first thing about me.

1194
01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:14.921
Oh, story time, okay.

1195
01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:17.251
- I am a legitimate businessman...
- Hmm.

1196
01:10:17.335 --> 01:10:20.165
...and if you think you can play
any of your dirty little tricks on me,

1197
01:10:20.251 --> 01:10:23.291
I think you'll find yourselves
sadly mistaken.

1198
01:10:23.376 --> 01:10:24.706
Hmm.

1199
01:10:24.793 --> 01:10:28.593
No, I don't think you understand,
you limey fucking dipshit.

1200
01:10:28.668 --> 01:10:30.538
See, we don't live in your world.

1201
01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.166
You live in ours.

1202
01:10:32.251 --> 01:10:33.501
You know that 800 grand?

1203
01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.210
Eight hundred thousand fucking dollars?

1204
01:10:36.293 --> 01:10:38.133
See, that's ours.

1205
01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:40.040
That's not yours.

1206
01:10:40.126 --> 01:10:41.746
You have until tonight to hand it over.

1207
01:10:41.835 --> 01:10:44.785
And if you don't hand it over,
you're gonna be fucked.

1208
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.040
So make sure to give us a call, okay?

1209
01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:51.753
You got that?

1210
01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.423
How's that lobster, Terry?

1211
01:10:57.168 --> 01:10:58.378
Pretty tasty.

1212
01:10:58.793 --> 01:11:00.043
You want some dessert or...

1213
01:11:00.126 --> 01:11:02.916
No, no, I gotta watch
the waistline here.

1214
01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:07.171
We should do this again sometime.
It was fun.

1215
01:11:07.251 --> 01:11:09.421
I look forward to it.
You've been delightful company.

1216
01:11:09.543 --> 01:11:10.923
Terry, that was sarcasm.

1217
01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:12.251
The lowest form of wit, Bob.

1218
01:11:13.418 --> 01:11:14.498
<i>Sayonara.</i>

1219
01:11:15.085 --> 01:11:16.165
<i>Sayonara.</i>

1220
01:11:18.376 --> 01:11:20.166
The goodbye! The goodbye.

1221
01:11:28.876 --> 01:11:32.746
- So Mangan got his sharks involved, huh?
- I have to say,

1222
01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:34.585
I'm disappointed.

1223
01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:36.248
I feel like you've let me down.

1224
01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:37.415
Aw!

1225
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.421
You can't carry out
that level of harassment

1226
01:11:39.501 --> 01:11:41.381
and think you can get away with it.

1227
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.210
If the guy was an Arab, yeah.

1228
01:11:43.293 --> 01:11:45.133
But this is a Brit we're talking about.

1229
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.090
Guy's a lord, apparently.
He's got a fucking OBE or something.

1230
01:11:49.168 --> 01:11:50.418
OBE? What the fuck is that?

1231
01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:53.251
Order of the British Empire.
Those fucking titles don't mean shit.

1232
01:11:53.335 --> 01:11:55.686
They don't mean shit to us, Bob,
but the Brits swear by 'em.

1233
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:59.250
- I'm a prince.
- This, it just ain't right.

1234
01:11:59.876 --> 01:12:00.996
It ain't right.

1235
01:12:01.085 --> 01:12:03.455
Not to mention, having cars
blown up outside your house.

1236
01:12:03.543 --> 01:12:05.769
And you looking like you just got
the shit kicked out of you.

1237
01:12:05.793 --> 01:12:07.383
Just a little domestic abuse.

1238
01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.540
And that wasn't even my car,
that was a four-by-four.

1239
01:12:09.876 --> 01:12:11.666
People don't like 'em,
they're gas-guzzlers.

1240
01:12:11.751 --> 01:12:13.711
Probably some Greenpeace
motherfucker torched it.

1241
01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:15.206
- Evil.
- They're assholes.

1242
01:12:15.293 --> 01:12:17.003
I know.

1243
01:12:17.085 --> 01:12:18.835
- Are you done?
- Yes.

1244
01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:20.248
Okay.

1245
01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.285
I'm gonna need your guns, too.

1246
01:12:23.918 --> 01:12:25.208
You think I care?

1247
01:12:26.168 --> 01:12:27.338
I don't even like this gun.

1248
01:12:31.835 --> 01:12:33.085
And clear out your desks.

1249
01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:34.671
There's nothing in my desk.

1250
01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:37.381
There is that one triple-murder case
from a couple years back.

1251
01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.590
Oh, yeah.

1252
01:12:38.668 --> 01:12:40.588
- I wonder who did that?
- We may never know.

1253
01:12:40.668 --> 01:12:41.998
- Hey, Bob.
- Yeah?

1254
01:12:42.085 --> 01:12:43.995
I'm telling you this as a friend.

1255
01:12:44.085 --> 01:12:46.125
He's gonna get you killed.

1256
01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:47.290
You know that, don't you?

1257
01:12:47.376 --> 01:12:49.126
Well, with all due respect,

1258
01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:50.490
you were never a friend of mine.

1259
01:12:51.126 --> 01:12:53.586
You were more a glorified
fucking acquaintance.

1260
01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.543
I'm staying with Terry
and his girlfriend.

1261
01:13:02.668 --> 01:13:04.498
They got this really cool place.

1262
01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.840
That's good.

1263
01:13:08.668 --> 01:13:09.998
It'll only be till you get out.

1264
01:13:10.293 --> 01:13:13.213
Terry says you got a good chance
of getting off at the trial.

1265
01:13:13.293 --> 01:13:15.173
Then we can live together again.

1266
01:13:17.668 --> 01:13:19.418
With your
husband's record, ma'am,

1267
01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:21.261
if we put that together
with some other shit,

1268
01:13:22.001 --> 01:13:24.041
like history of spousal abuse
or something...

1269
01:13:24.126 --> 01:13:26.036
That's not why I killed him.

1270
01:13:28.751 --> 01:13:30.631
I'm so sorry.

1271
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.210
I'm so, so sorry.

1272
01:13:44.418 --> 01:13:45.788
It's not fair.

1273
01:13:46.626 --> 01:13:48.036
No, it's not.

1274
01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.750
Life's a marked deck, kid.

1275
01:13:53.793 --> 01:13:55.383
Don't you ever forget it.

1276
01:14:01.376 --> 01:14:03.166
I hate jellyfish.

1277
01:14:03.626 --> 01:14:05.916
I wonder how in the hell
it got out here?

1278
01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:07.591
Maybe it fell from a spaceship.

1279
01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:14.088
Is it true they can sting you
even when they're dead?

1280
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:17.000
No, I think when they're dead,

1281
01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.535
they're dead.

1282
01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:23.130
They're immortal, though.

1283
01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:24.290
What?

1284
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.920
Jellyfish, they're immortal.

1285
01:14:28.043 --> 01:14:29.213
Bob told me.

1286
01:14:29.293 --> 01:14:31.453
Just because Bob says something
doesn't mean it's true.

1287
01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:32.961
Yeah, it does.

1288
01:14:33.043 --> 01:14:34.543
That's my greatest fear, actually.

1289
01:14:34.626 --> 01:14:35.956
Death by jellyfish.

1290
01:14:36.043 --> 01:14:39.463
Your greatest fear
is death by jellyfish? Okay.

1291
01:14:39.543 --> 01:14:40.843
It's not funny.

1292
01:14:40.918 --> 01:14:42.288
Random death by jellyfish.

1293
01:14:42.876 --> 01:14:46.126
This guy I knew, he caught a jellyfish,
put it in a jar,

1294
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:47.790
went out drinking,

1295
01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:49.628
got home... Listen to this.

1296
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:52.960
Got home and reached for what
he thought was a glass of water...

1297
01:14:53.626 --> 01:14:55.146
What do you think happened? He's dead.

1298
01:14:56.251 --> 01:14:59.131
Well, I'm glad you guys
find the idea so amusing.

1299
01:15:00.085 --> 01:15:01.705
Come on, you deadbeats.

1300
01:15:02.376 --> 01:15:04.286
Let's go get some <i>frijoles!</i>

1301
01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:06.998
- No, wait, I can't...
- Come on!

1302
01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:08.535
No, I can't run in these!

1303
01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:10.666
Come on!

1304
01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:14.460
'"I am real!'
said Alice, and began to cry.

1305
01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:18.091
'"You won't make yourself a bit realer
by crying, ' Tweedledee remarked:

1306
01:15:19.126 --> 01:15:20.996
""there's nothing to cry about.""

1307
01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.960
We'll finish this off tomorrow.

1308
01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:28.843
Daddy, what happens when you die?

1309
01:15:28.918 --> 01:15:31.248
Nothing. When you're dead, you're dead.

1310
01:15:31.751 --> 01:15:33.421
But isn't Mommy in heaven, Daddy?

1311
01:15:33.501 --> 01:15:35.341
No, she's not, darling.

1312
01:15:35.418 --> 01:15:38.708
What did I say?
It's just darkness forever.

1313
01:15:38.876 --> 01:15:41.876
Now, run along and play.
I have to speak to your Uncle Russell.

1314
01:15:46.251 --> 01:15:47.921
Growing up so quickly.

1315
01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.630
So what are we gonna do
about those two pricks?

1316
01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:01.835
They were fired today.

1317
01:16:01.918 --> 01:16:04.088
They are no longer
serving police officers.

1318
01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:06.338
They are civilians.

1319
01:16:07.126 --> 01:16:08.746
The fuck does that mean?

1320
01:16:08.835 --> 01:16:10.285
It's over?

1321
01:16:10.376 --> 01:16:12.086
No, it's not over, Russell.

1322
01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.421
Now we're going to kill them.

1323
01:16:24.543 --> 01:16:26.253
You almost broke my fucking cock!

1324
01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:28.460
Can you break a cock?

1325
01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:30.503
Well, I mean, the fucking tendons.

1326
01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:32.375
You snapped the fucking tendons.

1327
01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:51.590
Well, I gotta take a break.

1328
01:16:52.585 --> 01:16:54.285
Ruminate.

1329
01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.586
Consider options.

1330
01:16:57.210 --> 01:16:58.650
I'm gonna miss it, though, you know?

1331
01:16:59.543 --> 01:17:02.463
- Like, I liked the structure.
- The structure?

1332
01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:06.915
Maybe it's a good thing
that we got out, you know?

1333
01:17:07.835 --> 01:17:09.519
Things were just getting
a little too close to home

1334
01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:11.436
and, you know, when those things
start to happen...

1335
01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.170
Yeah. I'm not sure how much longer
you could've gotten away with it.

1336
01:17:16.168 --> 01:17:17.918
Especially with Terry.

1337
01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.540
Terry.

1338
01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:23.091
Hey, <i>toro!</i>

1339
01:17:29.585 --> 01:17:31.335
That's pretty fucking funny, huh?

1340
01:17:31.418 --> 01:17:32.838
Yeah, it's funny.

1341
01:17:32.918 --> 01:17:34.708
Yeah, you go, <i>toro.</i>

1342
01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.340
That's pretty good, huh?

1343
01:17:41.376 --> 01:17:43.536
When you got beat up last night,

1344
01:17:45.043 --> 01:17:47.713
did that have anything to do with me?

1345
01:17:48.293 --> 01:17:50.503
Of course not. Why would it?

1346
01:17:51.418 --> 01:17:53.128
I know why she did it.

1347
01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:55.341
Who?

1348
01:17:56.501 --> 01:17:57.711
My mom.

1349
01:17:59.626 --> 01:18:01.626
I know why she stabbed my dad.

1350
01:18:04.626 --> 01:18:06.706
She found out what he'd done.

1351
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.500
Well, what had he done?

1352
01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.290
Danny, what had he done?

1353
01:18:23.835 --> 01:18:26.165
He took me out to this place,

1354
01:18:26.251 --> 01:18:28.171
somewhere outside the city.

1355
01:18:29.376 --> 01:18:31.246
There were these people there.

1356
01:18:33.168 --> 01:18:34.788
They did things.

1357
01:18:35.418 --> 01:18:36.748
You know.

1358
01:18:41.293 --> 01:18:43.293
They filmed it as well.

1359
01:18:52.335 --> 01:18:53.415
Hmm.

1360
01:19:02.501 --> 01:19:04.671
And do you know
the names of these people?

1361
01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:09.541
Yeah, I know their names.

1362
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:04.790
Do you know why you're here, sir?

1363
01:21:05.793 --> 01:21:06.963
Go fuck yourself.

1364
01:21:08.793 --> 01:21:10.213
It's because I hate informers.

1365
01:21:11.543 --> 01:21:13.753
They have no honour.

1366
01:21:13.876 --> 01:21:15.626
They have no code.

1367
01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:16.790
Go fuck yourself.

1368
01:21:18.501 --> 01:21:21.171
This is the Lafayette sword.

1369
01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.381
From the Revolutionary War.

1370
01:21:23.543 --> 01:21:25.633
Yes, there was a revolution
in the United States.

1371
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:27.500
It's hard to believe, I know.

1372
01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:31.041
I stole it from a Masonic Lodge
in Illinois.

1373
01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:37.460
Have you heard of the writer
Yukio Mishima?

1374
01:21:39.126 --> 01:21:41.036
No, of course you haven't, you're Irish.

1375
01:21:41.126 --> 01:21:42.456
I was forgetting.

1376
01:21:42.543 --> 01:21:44.633
Anyway, in 1970,

1377
01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:47.750
Mishima attempted a coup
on his native Japan.

1378
01:21:47.835 --> 01:21:50.705
The coup failed
and Mishima committed seppuku,

1379
01:21:50.793 --> 01:21:53.593
or ritual disembowelment, if you prefer.

1380
01:21:54.668 --> 01:21:56.477
The second-in-command
was supposed to behead him

1381
01:21:56.501 --> 01:21:57.727
at the culmination of the ritual

1382
01:21:57.751 --> 01:22:01.501
but the poor chap was so bloody nervous
that he missed.

1383
01:22:04.293 --> 01:22:07.423
Mishima's bloody head
was hanging off him,

1384
01:22:07.501 --> 01:22:08.961
quite literally.

1385
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.420
Another chap had to step in
to finish him off.

1386
01:22:15.876 --> 01:22:18.086
Let's hope I don't miss, eh?

1387
01:22:18.168 --> 01:22:21.168
Fucking Brits.
You never know when to shut up.

1388
01:22:30.876 --> 01:22:32.036
Poor kid.

1389
01:22:33.251 --> 01:22:34.341
Yeah.

1390
01:22:36.043 --> 01:22:37.883
I've never killed anybody before.

1391
01:22:41.501 --> 01:22:43.091
Well, neither have I.

1392
01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.245
You know what they say.

1393
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.670
Always be open to new experiences.

1394
01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:56.880
I'll do this on my own.
You don't have to get involved.

1395
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.460
How come you always
look out for me, Bob?

1396
01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.920
Because you're a good friend of mine.

1397
01:23:25.543 --> 01:23:27.343
<i>I've got your money.</i>

1398
01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.500
You should be in bed.

1399
01:23:37.168 --> 01:23:38.838
Where's Lonesome Luke?

1400
01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:42.290
What?

1401
01:23:44.626 --> 01:23:47.376
I think he's gone to kill
a whole bunch of people.

1402
01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:57.090
You know that in Somalia
only men have gravestones?

1403
01:23:58.585 --> 01:24:01.835
Walt Whitman
was buried without his brain.

1404
01:24:03.376 --> 01:24:05.836
Descartes was buried
without his right hand.

1405
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:12.421
So you never wonder
who created this whole shebang?

1406
01:24:13.835 --> 01:24:14.915
No.

1407
01:24:16.501 --> 01:24:17.711
It's like

1408
01:24:18.710 --> 01:24:22.000
where does the universe begin
and where does it end?

1409
01:24:22.085 --> 01:24:24.785
And if you can't tell me that,
you can't tell me God doesn't exist.

1410
01:24:30.543 --> 01:24:32.673
But then again, Pythagoras believed

1411
01:24:32.751 --> 01:24:34.961
that after you're dead,

1412
01:24:35.043 --> 01:24:37.173
your soul goes into
a fucking green bean.

1413
01:24:37.251 --> 01:24:38.341
So what do I know?

1414
01:25:17.335 --> 01:25:19.245
Oh, I love this car!

1415
01:25:19.418 --> 01:25:21.628
She's fucking indestructible.

1416
01:25:33.001 --> 01:25:34.961
Like I always say, Bob,

1417
01:25:35.043 --> 01:25:37.883
if it ain't broke, break it.

1418
01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:07.843
Detectives, good to see you again.

1419
01:26:09.418 --> 01:26:10.788
You like Westerns, right?

1420
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:23.130
I don't have your $800,000.

1421
01:26:24.085 --> 01:26:25.915
I was never going to give it to you.

1422
01:26:26.876 --> 01:26:30.086
I thought I'd state that up front
in the interest of full disclosure.

1423
01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:32.591
You're not, uh,
so tough now, huh?

1424
01:26:33.251 --> 01:26:35.381
Without your motherfucking badge?

1425
01:26:35.585 --> 01:26:36.705
Hey, listen, man,

1426
01:26:36.876 --> 01:26:38.456
I know we don't see eye-to-eye, but...

1427
01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:40.376
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1428
01:26:41.501 --> 01:26:42.671
I'm fine.

1429
01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:53.036
I must say, you're taking
this turn of events rather well.

1430
01:26:53.168 --> 01:26:55.418
We haven't come here for the money.

1431
01:26:55.501 --> 01:26:57.841
- We don't care about the money any more.
- Oh.

1432
01:26:58.376 --> 01:27:00.086
This is about Danny Reynard.

1433
01:27:02.376 --> 01:27:03.916
Danny Reynard.

1434
01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.245
Hmm.

1435
01:27:06.418 --> 01:27:09.918
I can't quite place the name.

1436
01:27:23.918 --> 01:27:25.668
You know, one day,

1437
01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:27.631
these students were taking
a philosophy exam.

1438
01:27:27.793 --> 01:27:31.753
And at the start, the tutor
grabs a chair, puts it on a desk

1439
01:27:31.835 --> 01:27:33.535
and says, "For your last test,

1440
01:27:34.793 --> 01:27:36.503
"prove this chair exists."

1441
01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:39.036
So everyone's scribbling away,

1442
01:27:39.668 --> 01:27:40.918
except one guy.

1443
01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:43.921
He writes two words, gets up,

1444
01:27:44.085 --> 01:27:46.745
hands his paper to the tutor,

1445
01:27:46.835 --> 01:27:48.495
leaves the class.

1446
01:27:48.585 --> 01:27:49.955
Tutor looks at it

1447
01:27:50.585 --> 01:27:52.125
and on it, it says,

1448
01:27:52.751 --> 01:27:54.131
"What chair?"

1449
01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.000
Well, that's certainly very...

1450
01:28:05.835 --> 01:28:06.915
Fuck!

1451
01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.003
Fuck!

1452
01:28:52.335 --> 01:28:53.415
Bob?

1453
01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:01.706
Bob?

1454
01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:19.380
I love bulletproof vests.

1455
01:29:21.168 --> 01:29:22.788
Let's go fuck these scumbags.

1456
01:29:49.876 --> 01:29:51.706
I killed your snitch.

1457
01:29:54.793 --> 01:29:56.923
I chopped his fucking head off!

1458
01:30:01.168 --> 01:30:02.248
Wait.

1459
01:30:04.918 --> 01:30:05.998
Don't...

1460
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:09.880
I knew your last words would be shit.

1461
01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:20.591
All right.

1462
01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.168
All right, you made your point.

1463
01:30:30.085 --> 01:30:31.835
How much is this gonna cost me?

1464
01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.996
It's gonna cost you your life.

1465
01:30:35.835 --> 01:30:36.995
Nice line.

1466
01:30:48.668 --> 01:30:50.378
Well, that's a damn shame.

1467
01:30:51.793 --> 01:30:54.133
I kinda liked the guy,
in a funny sort of way.

1468
01:30:54.251 --> 01:30:56.591
His hair was receding quite a bit.

1469
01:30:58.335 --> 01:30:59.995
His teeth are all fucked up.

1470
01:31:00.626 --> 01:31:01.706
What are you doing?

1471
01:31:01.835 --> 01:31:03.625
Well, we gotta give him a decent burial.

1472
01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:06.961
What are we, savages?

1473
01:31:07.085 --> 01:31:10.035
Thought you were, like, keeping him
as a souvenir or something.

1474
01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:14.961
So that story about
the philosophy exam and the chair.

1475
01:31:15.043 --> 01:31:16.793
What does that actually mean?

1476
01:31:17.293 --> 01:31:19.343
It's not supposed to mean anything.

1477
01:31:19.418 --> 01:31:21.168
It's like a Zen koan.

1478
01:31:21.251 --> 01:31:22.921
Just ponder on it.

1479
01:31:23.001 --> 01:31:24.461
Just ponder on it?

1480
01:31:24.543 --> 01:31:26.293
Yeah. I fucked it up, though.

1481
01:31:26.376 --> 01:31:30.086
I was supposed to say,
"Prove the chair doesn't exist."

1482
01:31:31.335 --> 01:31:32.835
Ah!

1483
01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:34.668
So it doesn't exist, huh?

1484
01:31:52.126 --> 01:31:54.206
Man, that was some cold shit.

1485
01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:30.133
Wait, you going in?

1486
01:32:43.043 --> 01:32:44.673
So what's next, man?

1487
01:32:45.918 --> 01:32:47.668
I'm gonna live slow,

1488
01:32:47.751 --> 01:32:49.791
die old
and leave an ugly-looking corpse.

1489
01:32:50.210 --> 01:32:51.380
What are you gonna do?

1490
01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:54.091
I don't know.

1491
01:32:55.376 --> 01:32:56.706
Something sedate.

1492
01:32:59.085 --> 01:33:00.875
You think you're capable
of being sedate?

1493
01:33:02.293 --> 01:33:04.293
Well, Bob, it's like
the Buddha once said...

1494
01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.500
You're quoting fucking Buddha now?

1495
01:33:06.585 --> 01:33:08.745
Do not dwell in the past,

1496
01:33:09.668 --> 01:33:11.498
do not dream of the future.

1497
01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:15.131
Concentrate the mind
on the present moment.

1498
01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.590
I love this song.

1499
01:33:26.751 --> 01:33:27.881
Great song.

1500
01:33:29.835 --> 01:33:30.915
Masterpiece.

1501
01:33:36.373 --> 01:34:36.173
