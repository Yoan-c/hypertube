2
00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:03.665
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

3
00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:07.915
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.
Don't forget my share of the deal.

4
00:03:57.727 --> 00:03:58.708
Shit!

5
00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:43.296
- Tuna on white, no crust, right?
- I don't know. How is it?

6
00:04:43.974 --> 00:04:48.268
Every day, for the last three weeks,
you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

7
00:04:48.353 --> 00:04:52.102
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

8
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.978
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

9
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:57.520
- I'll have the tuna.
- No crust?

10
00:04:57.613 --> 00:04:58.692
No crust.

11
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.044
Thank you.

12
00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:13.476
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

13
00:06:13.564 --> 00:06:16.186
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

14
00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:19.361
- That's why you're unloading in third.
- Told you.

15
00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:24.570
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.
Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

16
00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:35.038
What's up with this fool?
Is he sandwich-crazy?

17
00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:39.754
- No. He ain't here for the food, dog.
- Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

18
00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:43.340
- I know what he's slinging.
- He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

19
00:06:43.428 --> 00:06:45.670
- What's up, guys?
- How you doing, Mia?

20
00:06:45.763 --> 00:06:47.922
- How you living, girl?
- Hey!

21
00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:50.924
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

22
00:07:01.946 --> 00:07:05.066
- He's beautiful.
- I like his haircut.

23
00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:08.817
Vince!

24
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.072
- What?
- Can I get you anything?

25
00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.114
You look good.

26
00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:21.967
- Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.
- Sure.

27
00:07:24.886 --> 00:07:26.843
- Tomorrow?
- I love this part.

28
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:36.228
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a
Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

29
00:07:36.314 --> 00:07:39.814
- I like the tuna here.
- Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

30
00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:41.312
Yeah, well, I do.

31
00:07:53.832 --> 00:07:57.367
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there? I'm sick of this shit.

32
00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:59.786
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

33
00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:06.667
- What did you put in that sandwich?
- That's funny.

34
00:08:06.762 --> 00:08:08.968
- Dom!
- All right.

35
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:30.362
- Hey, man. He was in my face.
- I'm in your face.

36
00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:34.913
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

37
00:08:37.585 --> 00:08:38.865
Get over there!

38
00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:42.170
Jesse, give me the wallet.

39
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.419
"Brian Earl Spilner. "
Sounds like a serial killer name.

40
00:08:48.554 --> 00:08:50.345
- Is that what you are?
- No, man.

41
00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:52.388
Don't come around here again.

42
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.719
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

43
00:08:57.772 --> 00:09:00.772
- You work for Harry, right?
- Yeah. I just started.

44
00:09:00.983 --> 00:09:02.525
You were just fired.

45
00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:18.576
Hey, Dominic.
I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

46
00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:20.579
Dominic, I owe you.

47
00:09:22.505 --> 00:09:27.048
Brian, you're messing with my business.
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

48
00:09:27.176 --> 00:09:31.803
Kids pour in. They want everything he has.
Every performance part. They pay cash!

49
00:09:32.348 --> 00:09:35.100
- What did Dominic say?
- You don't want to know.

50
00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:38.305
- What did Dominic say?
- He wants you out of here.

51
00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:40.854
- He wants me out of here?
- Yes.

52
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.226
- And what did you say to Dom?
- What do you think I said?

53
00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:47.018
I told him, "Good help is hard to find. "

54
00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:51.231
Relax.

55
00:09:54.913 --> 00:09:56.158
I need NOS.

56
00:09:56.706 --> 00:09:58.912
- I need NOS.
- No.

57
00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:01.871
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,
this morning.

58
00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:06.374
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've
seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

59
00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:10.295
- You'll blow yourself to pieces.
- I need one of these.

60
00:10:10.553 --> 00:10:13.922
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

61
00:10:14.432 --> 00:10:16.591
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

62
00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:31.667
Hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

63
00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:38.850
Sweet ride.
What you running under there, man?

64
00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:44.474
- Going to make me find out the hard way?
- Hell, yeah.

65
00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:47.435
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

66
00:11:48.068 --> 00:11:50.856
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it.

67
00:11:50.946 --> 00:11:53.402
- Brian Spilner.
- Typical white-boy name.

68
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:55.614
Know what I'm saying?

69
00:11:57.912 --> 00:12:02.787
See that over there? That's mine.
My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

70
00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:04.910
- Why not?
- I'm going legit, homey.

71
00:12:05.002 --> 00:12:07.671
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

72
00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:10.756
- Hell, yeah.
- So, what's up with you, man?

73
00:12:10.966 --> 00:12:15.130
- I'm just waiting for Toretto.
- Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

74
00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:18.796
- I'm standing next to it.
- That's funny.

75
00:12:18.933 --> 00:12:21.602
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

76
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:25.977
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

77
00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.316
...it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

78
00:12:35.283 --> 00:12:38.200
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

79
00:12:53.593 --> 00:12:55.384
- Dom.
- Marvin.

80
00:12:57.096 --> 00:13:00.679
- Hey, Dom. How you doing?
- Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

81
00:13:05.063 --> 00:13:07.980
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

82
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.853
I smell skanks.

83
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:17.439
Why don't you girls pack it up,
before I leave tread marks on your face?

84
00:13:17.534 --> 00:13:18.447
Okay.

85
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:21.371
- Letty, I was just talking.
- Yeah. Whatever.

86
00:13:21.788 --> 00:13:24.789
- Okay, Hector.
- Yeah? What's up, man?

87
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.043
- Yo. What's up?
- Edwin.

88
00:13:28.128 --> 00:13:30.500
- How we doing this tonight?
- One race.

89
00:13:31.005 --> 00:13:35.134
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.
Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

90
00:13:35.635 --> 00:13:38.636
- Why Hector?
- Too slow to make away with the money.

91
00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:43.768
- Okay. Good luck, guys.
- Hey, wait. Hold up.

92
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:48.136
I don't have any cash.
But I do have the pink slip to my car.

93
00:13:48.607 --> 00:13:52.439
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,
'cause you think you box.

94
00:13:52.652 --> 00:13:55.902
He knows I can box. Check it out.
It's like this.

95
00:13:56.907 --> 00:14:00.026
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

96
00:14:00.452 --> 00:14:03.821
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

97
00:14:04.456 --> 00:14:05.487
Respect.

98
00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:10.206
To some people, that's more important.

99
00:14:12.339 --> 00:14:13.667
That your car?

100
00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:22.297
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS
fogger system and a T 4 turbo, Dominic.

101
00:14:22.474 --> 00:14:27.432
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

102
00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:30.475
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

103
00:14:31.483 --> 00:14:33.559
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

104
00:14:36.572 --> 00:14:38.030
You see that shit?

105
00:14:38.907 --> 00:14:42.193
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

106
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.287
- So, what do you say? Am I worthy?
- We don't know yet.

107
00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:48.790
But you're in. Let's go.

108
00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:51.210
- All right.
- Let's go!

109
00:15:55.651 --> 00:15:59.483
- What the hell is going on around here?
- Street's closed, pizza boy.

110
00:15:59.989 --> 00:16:02.907
- Find another way home.
- Goddamn street racers.

111
00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:07.953
<i>Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've blocked the street.</i>

112
00:16:54.127 --> 00:16:55.502
Edwin.

113
00:16:57.047 --> 00:17:00.001
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

114
00:17:00.884 --> 00:17:03.505
But if you win, you get her, too.

115
00:17:13.021 --> 00:17:14.563
You're going to win.

116
00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:17.518
I'm going to win.

117
00:18:01.904 --> 00:18:04.774
<i>We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.</i>

118
00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:09.242
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

119
00:18:09.954 --> 00:18:11.364
- All right.
- Let's race!

120
00:18:11.455 --> 00:18:12.486
Right.

121
00:18:22.258 --> 00:18:23.040
Go!

122
00:18:37.189 --> 00:18:38.304
Hell, yeah!

123
00:18:54.373 --> 00:18:55.998
Damn, that guy's fast.

124
00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:06.333
Let's go! Ménage!

125
00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:36.158
No! Monica!

126
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:53.390
Shut up!

127
00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.607
Well done, baby!

128
00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:00.908
Come on. Come on. Back up.

129
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.044
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

130
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.001
You were racing a bunch of skateboards.
Know what I mean?

131
00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:12.096
My sister holds the money. Count it.

132
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.718
And you're my trophy.

133
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:23.928
- Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
- What's your problem? You didn't win.

134
00:21:26.902 --> 00:21:28.183
Fuck you then!

135
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.781
Was that fun?

136
00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:44.911
Got a problem there, buddy?

137
00:21:51.635 --> 00:21:54.886
- What are you smiling about?
- Dude. I almost had you.

138
00:21:57.725 --> 00:21:59.516
You almost had me?

139
00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:02.641
You never had me.
You never had your car.

140
00:22:05.942 --> 00:22:09.108
Granny-shifting.
Not double-clutching, like you should.

141
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:14.193
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

142
00:22:15.451 --> 00:22:19.829
- Almost had me?
- You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

143
00:22:21.207 --> 00:22:24.291
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

144
00:22:24.377 --> 00:22:26.950
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

145
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:36.760
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

146
00:22:37.515 --> 00:22:41.976
It don't matter if you win by an inch
or a mile. Winning's winning.

147
00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.598
Yeah!

148
00:22:49.194 --> 00:22:52.278
<i>All available units,
we have street-racing along Hawthorne...</i>

149
00:22:52.363 --> 00:22:54.273
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

150
00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:55.819
Go!

151
00:23:07.545 --> 00:23:09.337
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

152
00:24:33.591 --> 00:24:35.797
<i>Toretto, stop right there!</i>

153
00:24:37.511 --> 00:24:38.626
<i>Toretto!</i>

154
00:24:53.652 --> 00:24:54.851
Get in!

155
00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:44.701
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

156
00:25:45.872 --> 00:25:49.786
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

157
00:25:50.043 --> 00:25:53.376
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

158
00:25:54.255 --> 00:25:57.256
You drive like you've done this before.
Are you a wheelman?

159
00:25:57.342 --> 00:25:59.714
- No.
- You boost cars?

160
00:26:02.138 --> 00:26:04.297
- No. Never.
- Ever done time?

161
00:26:04.682 --> 00:26:07.008
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

162
00:26:07.769 --> 00:26:10.805
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

163
00:26:13.775 --> 00:26:15.269
Tucson, right?

164
00:26:15.985 --> 00:26:19.070
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

165
00:26:20.615 --> 00:26:23.782
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

166
00:26:24.494 --> 00:26:25.905
So, why bullshit?

167
00:26:27.622 --> 00:26:29.116
So, what about you?

168
00:26:31.585 --> 00:26:33.079
Two years in Lompoc.

169
00:26:36.131 --> 00:26:37.922
I'll die before I go back.

170
00:26:44.055 --> 00:26:46.048
- Oh, great.
- What?

171
00:26:48.977 --> 00:26:51.349
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

172
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:57.026
Follow us.

173
00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:51.956
I thought we had an agreement.
You stay away. I stay away.

174
00:27:53.375 --> 00:27:55.000
Everybody stays happy.

175
00:27:55.127 --> 00:27:57.452
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

176
00:27:57.546 --> 00:28:00.464
- Who's "we"?
- My new mechanic.

177
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:02.668
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

178
00:28:02.802 --> 00:28:05.803
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

179
00:28:05.888 --> 00:28:09.589
So, when are you going to give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

180
00:28:09.684 --> 00:28:12.091
- This your ride?
- It was. It's his now.

181
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.011
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

182
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:20.892
Then, it's nobody's car.
But somebody put in the wrench time.

183
00:28:23.948 --> 00:28:27.566
- What do you think, Lance?
- It's an amazing machine.

184
00:28:28.244 --> 00:28:29.703
Yes, indeed.

185
00:28:31.914 --> 00:28:33.325
Let's go.

186
00:28:35.501 --> 00:28:39.914
I'll see you in the desert next month.
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

187
00:28:40.173 --> 00:28:44.040
- You'll need more than that crotch rocket.
- I got something for you.

188
00:28:57.941 --> 00:29:01.475
- What the hell was that all about?
- Long story. I'll tell you later.

189
00:29:01.569 --> 00:29:03.194
Let's get out of here.

190
00:29:30.598 --> 00:29:31.713
NOS!

191
00:29:43.904 --> 00:29:47.320
- So, what the hell was that all about?
- It's a long story.

192
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.109
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

193
00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:53.242
A business deal that went sour.

194
00:29:54.206 --> 00:29:57.290
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

195
00:30:23.485 --> 00:30:24.730
Take care.

196
00:30:29.825 --> 00:30:31.367
Yo, Spilner.

197
00:30:32.786 --> 00:30:34.993
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

198
00:30:35.664 --> 00:30:37.242
Oh, shit.

199
00:31:01.315 --> 00:31:04.269
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

200
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.815
- With all that nitrous.
- Yeah.

201
00:31:13.702 --> 00:31:17.154
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go
looking for you, brother.

202
00:31:23.087 --> 00:31:24.367
Where were you?

203
00:31:24.463 --> 00:31:28.710
There were mass cops there. They came in
from every direction. It was orchestrated.

204
00:31:28.801 --> 00:31:31.173
- This your beer?
- Yeah, that's my beer.

205
00:31:34.265 --> 00:31:36.756
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

206
00:31:37.435 --> 00:31:39.973
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

207
00:31:40.813 --> 00:31:43.684
- Can't even get that right.
- You all right?

208
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.731
- Am I all right?
- It was just a question.

209
00:31:52.492 --> 00:31:53.772
Yo, Dom.

210
00:31:54.035 --> 00:31:58.115
- Why did you bring the buster here?
- 'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

211
00:31:58.373 --> 00:32:02.205
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

212
00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:11.839
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

213
00:32:12.512 --> 00:32:15.133
- Thanks, man.
- That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

214
00:32:17.141 --> 00:32:18.386
You.

215
00:32:25.525 --> 00:32:29.605
- Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?
- Upstairs. First door on the right.

216
00:32:45.837 --> 00:32:49.253
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

217
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:52.840
- He's right, Dom.
- There was a time when I didn't know you.

218
00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:54.920
That was in the third grade!

219
00:32:58.141 --> 00:33:01.641
- Yeah. So, what girls are here?
- You name it. You want mine?

220
00:33:01.728 --> 00:33:04.136
- You need to shut the...
- You want two?

221
00:33:04.356 --> 00:33:07.025
- You don't have anything?
- You look a bit tired.

222
00:33:07.109 --> 00:33:09.896
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

223
00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:13.355
- Look at all our guests.
- How about you give me a massage?

224
00:33:16.702 --> 00:33:18.160
Crazy lady.

225
00:33:25.836 --> 00:33:28.505
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

226
00:33:33.135 --> 00:33:34.415
Oh, shit.

227
00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:41.808
Did you wipe the seat?

228
00:33:45.063 --> 00:33:48.433
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?
Come on!

229
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:55.758
- Come on. Let's go get me a drink.
- We were just about to get along.

230
00:34:02.623 --> 00:34:05.790
- So, what do you want?
- Anything, as long as it's cold.

231
00:34:07.419 --> 00:34:11.002
You know, my brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

232
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.340
- He's a complicated guy.
- Yeah? What about you?

233
00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:19.880
- I'm simpler.
- You're a shitty liar.

234
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.926
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

235
00:34:25.604 --> 00:34:28.274
- But there's a problem.
- What's that?

236
00:34:28.357 --> 00:34:30.564
You need to get some sleep.

237
00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:35.101
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

238
00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:38.362
Come on. I'll take you home.

239
00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:03.098
<i>Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.</i>

240
00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:06.721
<i>Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.</i>

241
00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:10.854
<i>Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.</i>

242
00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:14.436
<i>Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.</i>

243
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:21.440
- What did I do?
- Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

244
00:35:32.213 --> 00:35:34.539
Damn!
Muse, will you take these things off?

245
00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:37.550
- Shit. You put them on so tight.
- I like realism.

246
00:35:38.178 --> 00:35:40.503
You never know who's watching, Brian.

247
00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:48.593
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated.

248
00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:52.900
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

249
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:55.985
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

250
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:03.075
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

251
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.486
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

252
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.787
- You told him what happened?
- He knows.

253
00:36:07.874 --> 00:36:11.789
- Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
- The kid's giving me attitude?

254
00:36:11.878 --> 00:36:14.630
It doesn't speak well
for police/FBI relations, Tanner.

255
00:36:14.714 --> 00:36:18.333
- I walk in the door and the guy's already-
- All right, all right.

256
00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:20.633
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

257
00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:24.006
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

258
00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:26.424
- Come on.
- Regular or decaf, Sarge?

259
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.430
Decaf, I think.

260
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:32.476
Four hijackings in two months,
and we have nothing.

261
00:36:32.566 --> 00:36:35.650
The DVD players and digital cameras
are worth $1.2 million...

262
00:36:35.736 --> 00:36:38.523
...which brings the grand total
to $6 million plus.

263
00:36:38.614 --> 00:36:41.449
We're in the political
crosshairs now, Brian.

264
00:36:42.201 --> 00:36:44.027
That's why you're undercover.

265
00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:48.069
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you want to know something?

266
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:51.250
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

267
00:36:52.294 --> 00:36:54.251
What does the truckdriver say?

268
00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:57.873
He gave us the same M.O.:
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

269
00:36:57.966 --> 00:37:00.920
...the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

270
00:37:01.011 --> 00:37:05.472
Lab says the skidmarks came back
the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.

271
00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:08.262
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

272
00:37:08.352 --> 00:37:12.813
If we don't make this case, the truckers
will take matters into their own hands.

273
00:37:12.898 --> 00:37:14.606
I tell them we're close.

274
00:37:15.818 --> 00:37:17.727
Are you going to make me a liar?

275
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.362
Look, what do we know?

276
00:37:19.446 --> 00:37:21.937
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

277
00:37:22.032 --> 00:37:25.117
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

278
00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:29.532
...but I can guarantee he knows who is.
It's just a matter of time until I win-

279
00:37:29.623 --> 00:37:33.573
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

280
00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:37.455
Just get me something I can use.

281
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.960
Is Harry cooperating?

282
00:37:41.052 --> 00:37:44.634
Like a guy that'll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

283
00:37:44.722 --> 00:37:46.845
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

284
00:37:46.932 --> 00:37:50.052
He's scared of him,
but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

285
00:37:50.144 --> 00:37:52.516
- He's too controlled for that.
- Wait.

286
00:37:52.605 --> 00:37:55.725
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

287
00:37:55.816 --> 00:37:59.351
...but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

288
00:37:59.445 --> 00:38:02.565
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

289
00:38:02.657 --> 00:38:04.566
Do not turn your back on him.

290
00:38:04.992 --> 00:38:06.535
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

291
00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:14.490
- What about parts and service?
- Hold off on it.

292
00:38:14.585 --> 00:38:16.911
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

293
00:38:20.008 --> 00:38:23.840
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

294
00:38:25.596 --> 00:38:28.004
- This is your car.
- My car?

295
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:31.595
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

296
00:38:31.686 --> 00:38:35.518
You could push this across the finish line,
or tow it.

297
00:38:36.816 --> 00:38:39.734
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

298
00:38:40.487 --> 00:38:41.685
No faith.

299
00:38:41.779 --> 00:38:44.187
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

300
00:38:44.282 --> 00:38:46.524
- This is a garage.
- Pop the hood.

301
00:38:46.826 --> 00:38:48.071
- Pop the hood?
- Pop the hood.

302
00:38:51.206 --> 00:38:54.871
- 2JZ engine. No shit.
- And what did I tell you?

303
00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:57.711
- I retract my previous statement.
- You know what?

304
00:38:57.796 --> 00:39:02.374
This will decimate all
after you put about $15,000 in it.

305
00:39:02.467 --> 00:39:06.216
Or more,
if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

306
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.384
- We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
- Yes!

307
00:39:09.808 --> 00:39:13.592
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

308
00:39:14.145 --> 00:39:16.850
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

309
00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.229
That's where you'll do it.

310
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:22.943
When you're not working at Harry's,
you're working here.

311
00:39:23.196 --> 00:39:26.945
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

312
00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:29.430
...you don't belong near a car.

313
00:39:33.123 --> 00:39:34.498
He owns you now.

314
00:40:01.819 --> 00:40:03.610
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

315
00:40:04.446 --> 00:40:06.653
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

316
00:40:06.865 --> 00:40:10.199
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

317
00:40:10.285 --> 00:40:11.530
All right?

318
00:40:12.371 --> 00:40:14.447
This is your basic layout of the car.

319
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:18.372
And that's pretty much
what it could look like when it's finished.

320
00:40:19.128 --> 00:40:20.503
Red, green.

321
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.665
- You should be going to MIT or something.
- Yeah, right.

322
00:40:25.342 --> 00:40:28.177
No, I got that... What's it called?

323
00:40:29.263 --> 00:40:31.421
That attention disorder-

324
00:40:31.515 --> 00:40:35.216
- ADD?
- Yes, that shit. Yeah.

325
00:40:36.353 --> 00:40:40.268
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

326
00:40:41.108 --> 00:40:44.857
Everything else I failed.
Dropped out of school.

327
00:40:45.738 --> 00:40:48.858
I don't know.
It's just something about engines...

328
00:40:48.949 --> 00:40:52.069
...that calms me down, you know.

329
00:41:12.932 --> 00:41:15.388
- I'm outta here.
- Come on, dog.

330
00:41:16.018 --> 00:41:18.688
- Yo, Dom.
- Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

331
00:41:18.771 --> 00:41:21.689
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

332
00:41:35.371 --> 00:41:38.491
- Mia! The chicken's dry.
- All right. I'm coming out already.

333
00:41:43.838 --> 00:41:45.332
Here you go.

334
00:41:47.258 --> 00:41:48.669
Hey, hold up.

335
00:41:49.177 --> 00:41:54.420
Because you were the first to reach in
to get the chicken, you say grace.

336
00:42:00.438 --> 00:42:03.143
- Dear heavenly...
- Spirit.

337
00:42:04.818 --> 00:42:06.478
Spirit. Thank you.

338
00:42:07.028 --> 00:42:12.236
Thank you for providing us
with a direct port nitrous injection...

339
00:42:13.201 --> 00:42:17.033
...four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

340
00:42:17.205 --> 00:42:19.696
...and titanium valve springs.

341
00:42:20.458 --> 00:42:22.083
- Thank you.
- Amen.

342
00:42:23.211 --> 00:42:25.168
- Not bad.
- Amen.

343
00:42:25.255 --> 00:42:27.497
He was praying to the car gods, man.

344
00:42:28.842 --> 00:42:30.384
He's not the best.

345
00:42:30.468 --> 00:42:32.627
- What do you want?
- Practice.

346
00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:34.049
Thank you, girl.

347
00:42:34.139 --> 00:42:37.722
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us. "

348
00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:40.561
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

349
00:42:40.729 --> 00:42:43.683
- You know, I gotta eat.
- He's always hungry.

350
00:42:43.774 --> 00:42:45.813
All right, sit down.

351
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.109
How you doing, Mia?

352
00:42:58.288 --> 00:42:59.913
Here you go.

353
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.131
- Jesse, hand me that chicken.
- Let's eat some grub, man.

354
00:43:09.216 --> 00:43:12.336
- Want some of that chicken?
- What, you rent a movie or something?

355
00:43:19.435 --> 00:43:21.344
Need a hand with anything else?

356
00:43:21.437 --> 00:43:24.888
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys
and watch the movie.

357
00:43:25.399 --> 00:43:29.064
- The cook doesn't clean where I come from.
- I'd like to go there.

358
00:43:34.241 --> 00:43:38.453
- I think we should go out sometime.
- No, I don't date my brother's friends.

359
00:43:39.163 --> 00:43:40.657
That sucks.

360
00:43:40.748 --> 00:43:44.081
- I'll have to kick his ass then.
- I'd love to see that one.

361
00:43:44.168 --> 00:43:47.453
I would pay to see that one, actually.

362
00:44:01.394 --> 00:44:03.102
Wash my car when you get done.

363
00:44:03.187 --> 00:44:06.852
- What was that?
- No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

364
00:44:07.692 --> 00:44:10.147
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

365
00:44:10.236 --> 00:44:13.521
...I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

366
00:44:16.826 --> 00:44:20.526
Is this thing broken?
What's wrong with this thing?

367
00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:25.787
What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

368
00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.953
The one with the picadillo and-

369
00:44:28.045 --> 00:44:31.829
- With red candles, wooden tables-
- The plantain, food all over the place.

370
00:44:31.924 --> 00:44:33.798
- What it's called?
- Cha Cha Cha.

371
00:44:33.885 --> 00:44:35.842
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

372
00:44:37.013 --> 00:44:39.005
Well, you can take me there.

373
00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.761
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

374
00:44:42.393 --> 00:44:44.433
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Good.

375
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.774
- There's no popcorn.
- Make your own goddamn popcorn!

376
00:45:08.795 --> 00:45:11.368
All right. Now that's valet parking.

377
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:17.590
- Harry. What's up, dog?
- Nice to see you.

378
00:45:17.679 --> 00:45:19.506
Excellent. Come on in, man.

379
00:45:19.597 --> 00:45:22.717
- Check it. It's yours.
- Damn. What do we got here?

380
00:45:23.852 --> 00:45:26.343
- Hired some new help?
- Don't even think about it.

381
00:45:26.438 --> 00:45:28.893
- What's up?
- What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

382
00:45:28.982 --> 00:45:31.899
- Pretty good. What do you need?
- What's up, man?

383
00:45:31.985 --> 00:45:35.520
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

384
00:45:37.157 --> 00:45:39.114
Why don't you look that over?

385
00:45:39.409 --> 00:45:42.576
- When do you need this stuff by?
- Tomorrow, today, now.

386
00:45:42.996 --> 00:45:45.238
- Right.
- White boys work fast, don't they?

387
00:45:48.502 --> 00:45:49.830
That's right.

388
00:45:52.714 --> 00:45:56.214
- You said you need three of each?
- Yeah, three of everything.

389
00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:59.680
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

390
00:48:07.809 --> 00:48:09.351
He moans like a cop.

391
00:48:18.653 --> 00:48:22.817
Brian, this is one of those times
you need to be clear about what you say.

392
00:48:23.575 --> 00:48:25.567
Nod if you understand me.

393
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.941
Nod!

394
00:48:28.788 --> 00:48:30.199
Sit up.

395
00:48:36.463 --> 00:48:39.132
Tell me what the hell you're doing
down here.

396
00:48:39.424 --> 00:48:41.880
Shit. What I'm doing?

397
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:45.846
Dom.

398
00:48:48.099 --> 00:48:50.804
I owe you a 10-second car.

399
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:55.388
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

400
00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:02.436
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

401
00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:05.444
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

402
00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:08.411
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

403
00:49:08.495 --> 00:49:12.742
...and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

404
00:49:14.376 --> 00:49:16.452
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

405
00:49:19.965 --> 00:49:21.673
So, what are you saying?

406
00:49:22.885 --> 00:49:27.428
You're gonna check everybody's shit out,
one garage after another?

407
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:31.767
Yeah.

408
00:49:34.605 --> 00:49:38.519
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

409
00:49:40.527 --> 00:49:41.903
He's a cop.

410
00:49:44.239 --> 00:49:45.354
He's a cop!

411
00:49:48.661 --> 00:49:49.989
You a cop?

412
00:49:56.502 --> 00:49:58.329
Let's go for a little ride.

413
00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.715
Walk!

414
00:50:22.111 --> 00:50:23.819
Okay. You stand watch.

415
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.220
Yo, Dominic.

416
00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.640
There's no engines.

417
00:51:00.775 --> 00:51:03.527
What are they planning on racing with,
hopes and dreams?

418
00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:06.019
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...

419
00:51:06.114 --> 00:51:08.949
...and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

420
00:51:14.122 --> 00:51:15.071
What?

421
00:51:24.215 --> 00:51:25.544
We got a wolf pack.

422
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:29.716
<i>It's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way really fast.</i>

423
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.801
All right, we got company. Spilner.

424
00:51:58.792 --> 00:52:01.081
Come on. Move!

425
00:52:01.336 --> 00:52:03.376
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

426
00:52:04.881 --> 00:52:08.085
- Do you see anything wrong here?
- No.

427
00:52:11.972 --> 00:52:14.379
- We got no engines, do we?
- No.

428
00:52:14.474 --> 00:52:15.755
- Do we?
- No.

429
00:52:18.854 --> 00:52:21.427
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

430
00:52:21.523 --> 00:52:24.559
- ... one week before Race Wars, huh?
- Yeah, probably.

431
00:52:24.943 --> 00:52:27.944
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

432
00:52:29.448 --> 00:52:31.357
What are you feeling, Lance?

433
00:52:32.868 --> 00:52:34.410
40-weight?

434
00:52:34.912 --> 00:52:36.738
50-weight?

435
00:52:37.372 --> 00:52:39.080
A 40-weight sounds nice.

436
00:52:54.682 --> 00:52:56.224
Where are they, Ted?

437
00:52:56.392 --> 00:52:58.218
- Where are they?
- Enough!

438
00:52:58.394 --> 00:53:00.885
- Where are they?
- They're in a warehouse.

439
00:53:01.438 --> 00:53:03.348
They're in a warehouse, man!

440
00:53:19.623 --> 00:53:20.904
Ted.

441
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.660
Kiss my shoes?

442
00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:36.804
Let's go get our engines.

443
00:53:37.683 --> 00:53:40.470
My superiors are flying in from D.C.,
in two days.

444
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:42.186
I want something to show.

445
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:44.762
We've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

446
00:53:44.857 --> 00:53:48.475
...automatic weapons,
priors on every one of these Asian punks...

447
00:53:48.569 --> 00:53:51.903
...a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

448
00:53:51.989 --> 00:53:55.358
Tell me why we shouldn't move
on Tran now and figure it out later?

449
00:53:55.451 --> 00:53:57.195
Because all we have is behavior.

450
00:53:57.286 --> 00:54:00.371
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just-

451
00:54:00.456 --> 00:54:02.449
What we have is probable cause.

452
00:54:02.542 --> 00:54:06.409
And truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

453
00:54:06.504 --> 00:54:10.584
- Tell us about Hector, Brian.
- Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

454
00:54:10.842 --> 00:54:14.424
Hector's still working on the engines,
but the tires don't match.

455
00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:16.303
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

456
00:54:16.389 --> 00:54:18.512
- Get him a cigarette.
- Don't give him one.

457
00:54:18.766 --> 00:54:21.222
- I thought you quit.
- I did. Just give me one.

458
00:54:21.311 --> 00:54:23.054
- Get him a cigarette.
- No!

459
00:54:25.356 --> 00:54:26.981
Tell me about Toretto.

460
00:54:27.233 --> 00:54:30.020
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

461
00:54:30.111 --> 00:54:34.738
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.
Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

462
00:54:35.116 --> 00:54:38.781
- I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.
- What did you say?

463
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:42.453
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

464
00:54:45.251 --> 00:54:46.496
Knock it off!

465
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.208
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

466
00:54:54.886 --> 00:54:57.128
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

467
00:54:57.389 --> 00:54:59.714
- Yeah. I memorized that file.
- Read it again.

468
00:54:59.808 --> 00:55:02.215
No, better still, take a look at these.

469
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.389
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

470
00:55:07.816 --> 00:55:11.101
Toretto did this
with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

471
00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:13.568
He's a model of self-control.

472
00:55:16.491 --> 00:55:18.199
I need a few more days.

473
00:55:20.954 --> 00:55:22.152
I need a few more days.

474
00:55:25.083 --> 00:55:26.661
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

475
00:55:28.045 --> 00:55:31.912
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

476
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:34.581
- I got this set up for 24 psi.
- Got it.

477
00:55:38.096 --> 00:55:39.888
You got big plans tonight?

478
00:55:42.017 --> 00:55:44.175
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

479
00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:48.344
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

480
00:55:48.982 --> 00:55:50.477
That's not gonna happen.

481
00:55:55.656 --> 00:55:57.483
I want to show you something.

482
00:56:11.755 --> 00:56:13.463
Me and my dad built her.

483
00:56:14.341 --> 00:56:16.713
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

484
00:56:18.012 --> 00:56:19.257
It's a beast.

485
00:56:19.847 --> 00:56:22.717
- You know what she ran in Palmdale?
- No. What?

486
00:56:22.892 --> 00:56:24.350
Nine seconds flat.

487
00:56:25.853 --> 00:56:27.976
- God.
- My dad was driving.

488
00:56:28.522 --> 00:56:32.734
So much torque,
the chassis twisted coming off the line.

489
00:56:33.819 --> 00:56:35.776
Barely kept her on the track.

490
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:39.448
- So, what's your best time?
- I've never driven her.

491
00:56:39.533 --> 00:56:40.613
Why not?

492
00:56:43.371 --> 00:56:45.328
It scares the shit out of me.

493
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:48.995
That's my dad.

494
00:56:50.503 --> 00:56:53.208
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

495
00:56:53.631 --> 00:56:55.339
Last race of the season.

496
00:56:56.467 --> 00:57:00.679
A guy named Kenny Linder
came up from inside, in the final turn.

497
00:57:01.514 --> 00:57:05.013
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

498
00:57:08.187 --> 00:57:10.559
I watched my dad burn to death.

499
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:15.185
I remembered hearing him scream.

500
00:57:18.364 --> 00:57:22.907
But the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew.

501
00:57:29.292 --> 00:57:31.664
They said it was me who was screaming.

502
00:57:35.214 --> 00:57:37.622
I saw Linder about a week later.

503
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.426
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

504
00:57:42.764 --> 00:57:47.473
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,
but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

505
00:57:52.857 --> 00:57:55.146
He's a janitor at a high school.

506
00:57:56.277 --> 00:57:58.815
He has to take the bus to work every day.

507
00:58:00.031 --> 00:58:02.736
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

508
00:58:08.373 --> 00:58:10.864
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

509
00:58:12.711 --> 00:58:15.498
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

510
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:18.080
...not my team and all their bullshit.

511
00:58:19.801 --> 00:58:22.173
For those 10 seconds or less...

512
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.340
...I'm free.

513
00:58:45.827 --> 00:58:49.078
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

514
00:58:49.331 --> 00:58:50.446
- What?
- The gang.

515
00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.948
The gang?
No, they don't call themselves a gang.

516
00:58:53.043 --> 00:58:55.368
- What do they call themselves?
- They're a team.

517
00:58:55.462 --> 00:58:59.460
- They call themselves a team.
- All right. How did the team come to be?

518
00:58:59.925 --> 00:59:02.214
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

519
00:59:03.637 --> 00:59:07.338
- I've got time.
- Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

520
00:59:08.308 --> 00:59:11.428
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

521
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.513
But they were friends as kids.

522
00:59:13.731 --> 00:59:16.304
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

523
00:59:16.483 --> 00:59:19.733
Always into cars, though.
Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

524
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.403
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

525
00:59:24.074 --> 00:59:27.739
- And then she turned 16-
- And then she had Dom's attention.

526
00:59:28.037 --> 00:59:30.954
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

527
00:59:31.707 --> 00:59:32.952
Yeah.

528
00:59:36.253 --> 00:59:38.744
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

529
00:59:38.881 --> 00:59:43.839
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of
showed up one night and never, ever left.

530
00:59:44.678 --> 00:59:47.964
It's just the way my brother is, you know.
Dom's like...

531
00:59:49.517 --> 00:59:51.474
He's like gravity.

532
00:59:52.603 --> 00:59:54.809
Everything just gets pulled to him.

533
00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.816
Even you.

534
01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:01.403
No.

535
01:00:01.529 --> 01:00:02.904
No.

536
01:00:03.364 --> 01:00:06.199
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

537
01:00:06.284 --> 01:00:09.119
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

538
01:00:11.873 --> 01:00:13.415
That's good.

539
01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:18.786
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

540
01:00:22.425 --> 01:00:23.456
Want to go for a drive?

541
01:01:02.173 --> 01:01:04.415
<i>- Yeah?
- The hijackers have hit again.</i>

542
01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:09.586
<i>Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move
on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.</i>

543
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:11.555
<i>Unless you say otherwise.</i>

544
01:01:11.641 --> 01:01:13.515
<i>If you agree, just say yes.</i>

545
01:01:14.144 --> 01:01:16.136
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

546
01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:20.141
It's just a wrong number.

547
01:04:12.365 --> 01:04:14.524
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but-

548
01:04:14.743 --> 01:04:17.412
Yeah. Yes, sir.

549
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.031
Yeah. I got it.

550
01:04:23.418 --> 01:04:25.457
The DVD players were purchased legally.

551
01:04:25.545 --> 01:04:28.795
All we've got are a couple
of low-rent weapons charges...

552
01:04:28.882 --> 01:04:31.171
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

553
01:04:31.259 --> 01:04:32.919
- So, they're out.
- Yeah.

554
01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.714
Father bailed them out.

555
01:04:35.847 --> 01:04:39.596
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

556
01:04:44.439 --> 01:04:47.606
- You're gonna put this on me?
- I can put it on whoever I want to.

557
01:04:47.692 --> 01:04:50.397
- Perks of the job.
- No, you can't put this on me-

558
01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:52.361
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

559
01:04:52.447 --> 01:04:56.659
I don't care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens.

560
01:04:56.743 --> 01:04:59.281
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

561
01:04:59.371 --> 01:05:02.455
...or you might want to think
about another career.

562
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.926
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

563
01:05:18.307 --> 01:05:20.180
Tran and Hector are...

564
01:05:20.601 --> 01:05:22.392
They're just fumes.

565
01:05:25.647 --> 01:05:28.352
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

566
01:05:28.442 --> 01:05:32.107
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

567
01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.733
He won't go back to prison.

568
01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:40.572
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

569
01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:47.074
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

570
01:05:48.504 --> 01:05:51.291
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

571
01:06:09.316 --> 01:06:11.309
You ready for this?

572
01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.555
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

573
01:06:41.182 --> 01:06:43.755
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

574
01:06:49.941 --> 01:06:51.435
Smoke him.

575
01:07:46.373 --> 01:07:48.164
So, what's wrong, Brian?

576
01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:50.833
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

577
01:07:51.294 --> 01:07:54.544
Come on. Obviously something's off.

578
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:58.790
Look, I have my good days and bad days
just like anybody else.

579
01:07:59.469 --> 01:08:03.052
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

580
01:08:05.016 --> 01:08:07.852
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

581
01:08:08.019 --> 01:08:09.478
I got the shrimp.

582
01:08:09.896 --> 01:08:12.470
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

583
01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:16.231
I don't take handouts.
I earn my way, every step.

584
01:08:17.154 --> 01:08:19.526
I need something extra on the side,
like you.

585
01:08:19.615 --> 01:08:21.572
What do you mean, like me?

586
01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:24.737
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what I mean.

587
01:08:24.828 --> 01:08:27.533
- What does that mean, like me?
- Don't try-

588
01:08:27.831 --> 01:08:29.740
I'm not stupid, all right?

589
01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:34.205
I know that there's no way you paid
for all that shit you got under the hood-

590
01:08:34.296 --> 01:08:37.665
There's no way you paid for
what's under the hood of those cars...

591
01:08:37.758 --> 01:08:40.510
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

592
01:08:41.345 --> 01:08:44.346
Whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

593
01:09:07.204 --> 01:09:09.280
- Well, what is this?
- Read it.

594
01:09:10.082 --> 01:09:12.371
- What is this for?
- It's directions.

595
01:09:14.378 --> 01:09:16.086
To Race Wars.

596
01:09:16.589 --> 01:09:18.380
We'll see how you go.

597
01:09:19.383 --> 01:09:21.008
Then we'll talk.

598
01:10:07.306 --> 01:10:08.931
- How's it going?
- What's up?

599
01:10:09.017 --> 01:10:11.686
- Welcome to Race Wars.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

600
01:10:35.085 --> 01:10:36.792
Baby. Hey, baby.

601
01:10:37.962 --> 01:10:39.789
You should watch from the side.

602
01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:42.337
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

603
01:10:42.425 --> 01:10:46.505
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

604
01:10:46.596 --> 01:10:49.052
You want ass,
why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

605
01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.225
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

606
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:55.311
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

607
01:10:57.983 --> 01:10:59.393
You got it.

608
01:11:19.421 --> 01:11:21.460
"Another one bites the dust"

609
01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.669
Come on. What you got?

610
01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:28.846
See ya.

611
01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:07.796
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up, Jesse?

612
01:12:08.262 --> 01:12:09.542
What's in your hand?

613
01:12:09.638 --> 01:12:12.010
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

614
01:12:12.099 --> 01:12:14.720
- The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
- Yeah.

615
01:12:15.144 --> 01:12:17.682
- You can't bet your dad's car.
- It's all right.

616
01:12:17.771 --> 01:12:19.052
I ain't losing.

617
01:12:19.148 --> 01:12:22.647
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

618
01:12:22.818 --> 01:12:27.361
That way, me and my dad can roll
when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

619
01:12:27.448 --> 01:12:31.066
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

620
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:40.666
You visualize the win.

621
01:12:40.753 --> 01:12:44.418
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

622
01:12:44.507 --> 01:12:46.049
Who are you racing?

623
01:12:50.429 --> 01:12:52.636
Jesse, don't do it.

624
01:12:52.765 --> 01:12:56.430
I bet you he's got more than $100,000
under the hood of that car.

625
01:13:19.584 --> 01:13:21.161
Too soon, junior.

626
01:13:24.797 --> 01:13:25.663
No!

627
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:30.000
Shit!

628
01:13:30.637 --> 01:13:31.799
Oh, God!

629
01:13:42.232 --> 01:13:44.901
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

630
01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:46.728
- What?
- Jesse.

631
01:13:48.238 --> 01:13:50.277
Where's Jesse going?

632
01:13:50.448 --> 01:13:53.948
- He just raced Tran for slips.
- Oh, shit.

633
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:08.750
- Where's he going?
- He went to the car wash.

634
01:14:08.967 --> 01:14:10.924
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

635
01:14:11.511 --> 01:14:13.136
Go fetch your car?

636
01:14:14.097 --> 01:14:15.757
We're not on your block.

637
01:14:15.849 --> 01:14:18.470
You better watch who you talk to like that.

638
01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:20.133
Toretto!

639
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.314
SWAT came into my house...

640
01:14:26.276 --> 01:14:30.523
...disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narked me out.

641
01:14:31.239 --> 01:14:33.695
And you know what? It was you!

642
01:14:58.058 --> 01:15:00.098
Get off of him, man.

643
01:15:09.445 --> 01:15:11.236
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

644
01:15:11.322 --> 01:15:13.113
I never narked on nobody!

645
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.731
I never narked on nobody!

646
01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.820
Mia.

647
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.952
I have respected you
and I haven't said shit.

648
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.784
Now I am asking you not to go.

649
01:16:04.876 --> 01:16:07.746
- I'm doing this for both of us.
- Don't give me that crap.

650
01:16:07.837 --> 01:16:09.296
You're doing this for you.

651
01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:13.508
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

652
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.971
- Mia, what's going on?
- What?

653
01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:30.557
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

654
01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.902
You always have tears in your eyes
when Dom drives away?

655
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:35.572
What's the matter with you?

656
01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:38.230
What's he racing off
in the middle of the night for?

657
01:16:38.326 --> 01:16:41.493
- You know about the trucks?
- No, Brian! What trucks?

658
01:16:41.579 --> 01:16:45.447
- Jesus Christ. What?
- Listen to me.

659
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:48.168
Mia, I'm a cop.

660
01:16:49.712 --> 01:16:52.382
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

661
01:16:52.465 --> 01:16:55.917
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

662
01:16:57.178 --> 01:16:58.376
I'm a cop.

663
01:17:03.435 --> 01:17:05.059
Oh, you bastard.

664
01:17:07.897 --> 01:17:09.178
You bastard.

665
01:17:11.568 --> 01:17:13.395
- Mia.
- Get off of me, Brian!

666
01:17:13.486 --> 01:17:15.230
Mia! Listen to me!

667
01:17:16.489 --> 01:17:19.063
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

668
01:17:19.159 --> 01:17:21.780
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

669
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:25.488
But this isn't about you and me.
Your brother's out there to pull a job.

670
01:17:25.582 --> 01:17:29.033
We're running out of time. Those truckers
aren't laying down anymore.

671
01:17:29.127 --> 01:17:32.876
Maybe they'll make it through tonight,
but every law enforcement agency...

672
01:17:32.964 --> 01:17:34.672
...is coming down on them.

673
01:17:34.758 --> 01:17:37.675
If you don't want anything to happen
to them...

674
01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:40.845
...you have to get in that car
with me right now and help me.

675
01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:45.724
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

676
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.853
Please, Mia. Please help me.

677
01:18:01.785 --> 01:18:04.620
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

678
01:18:04.705 --> 01:18:07.990
They wouldn't double back,
and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

679
01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.037
- So, what does that leave us with?
- All this.

680
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:22.841
<i>- Nextel.
- This is Officer Brian O'Conner.</i>

681
01:18:23.015 --> 01:18:27.392
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

682
01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:30.639
<i>- Okay. What's the cell number?
- Mia, what is it?</i>

683
01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:35.941
Come on, Mia.
She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

684
01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:43.990
323-555-6439.

685
01:18:45.079 --> 01:18:47.652
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

686
01:19:13.858 --> 01:19:17.690
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

687
01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:23.323
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

688
01:19:23.451 --> 01:19:27.579
- Don't do that.
- Something's wrong.

689
01:19:27.663 --> 01:19:30.499
- Stop.
- We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

690
01:19:31.626 --> 01:19:34.580
This is the mother lode.
We've been on this for three months.

691
01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:37.162
After this,
it's a long vacation for everyone.

692
01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:39.214
- Let's go.
- I hope so.

693
01:19:42.762 --> 01:19:45.846
Listen, the other night I had a dream...

694
01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:49.054
...that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

695
01:19:49.435 --> 01:19:51.475
- Really?
- Really.

696
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:56.807
Come on. Let's make this happen.

697
01:19:59.904 --> 01:20:04.400
- Leon, keep on those scanners.
- Copy that.

698
01:20:07.954 --> 01:20:09.994
All right, let's go.

699
01:20:20.592 --> 01:20:23.676
<i>Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.</i>

700
01:20:23.762 --> 01:20:28.258
<i>Mile 114, outside Coachella.
We'll keep the trace open, Officer.</i>

701
01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.011
Let me see this.

702
01:20:34.814 --> 01:20:37.056
I think we're about 40 miles away.

703
01:20:37.484 --> 01:20:39.108
What are you gonna do?

704
01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:42.396
What are you gonna do?

705
01:21:14.688 --> 01:21:16.764
Okay! Go time!

706
01:21:32.456 --> 01:21:34.912
We're all good.
I got nothing on the scanners.

707
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.281
Keep going.

708
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.012
Vince!

709
01:21:52.685 --> 01:21:54.761
Vince, don't! Get back in!

710
01:21:56.355 --> 01:21:57.470
Vince!

711
01:22:03.112 --> 01:22:04.820
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

712
01:22:04.905 --> 01:22:07.194
Back off! Get him off of there!

713
01:22:09.869 --> 01:22:11.149
Oh, shit!

714
01:22:22.214 --> 01:22:24.884
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

715
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:29.344
Unhook yourself. Do it!

716
01:22:29.722 --> 01:22:31.715
- Do it!
- I can't get-

717
01:22:31.808 --> 01:22:33.183
You can do it!

718
01:22:34.227 --> 01:22:35.685
Come on, Vince!

719
01:22:43.194 --> 01:22:45.767
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

720
01:22:53.246 --> 01:22:54.705
Come on, boy!

721
01:22:55.915 --> 01:22:58.038
Shot doesn't get better than this.

722
01:23:03.089 --> 01:23:04.370
Son of a bitch!

723
01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.546
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

724
01:23:11.639 --> 01:23:15.886
Try it again. One, two, three!

725
01:23:27.906 --> 01:23:29.483
Unhook yourself!

726
01:23:31.242 --> 01:23:33.116
I can't get my arm free!

727
01:23:33.203 --> 01:23:35.445
- Vince, grab my hand!
- My arm!

728
01:23:35.538 --> 01:23:37.330
Listen, give me your hand.

729
01:23:37.499 --> 01:23:39.954
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

730
01:23:43.129 --> 01:23:44.754
Vince!

731
01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.832
Hold on!

732
01:23:46.925 --> 01:23:49.048
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

733
01:23:55.892 --> 01:23:56.888
Dominic!

734
01:23:56.977 --> 01:23:58.175
Shit!

735
01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:03.855
- Dominic!
- Hang on!

736
01:24:04.443 --> 01:24:07.360
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

737
01:24:32.471 --> 01:24:33.799
Letty!

738
01:24:34.598 --> 01:24:35.629
Leon!

739
01:24:35.724 --> 01:24:36.803
Pull back for Letty.

740
01:24:36.892 --> 01:24:38.172
<i>Get her out of there!</i>

741
01:24:38.268 --> 01:24:39.679
I'm on it! Go!

742
01:24:48.862 --> 01:24:51.532
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

743
01:24:56.871 --> 01:24:59.112
Letty! Come on, baby.

744
01:25:00.165 --> 01:25:01.245
You okay?

745
01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:03.741
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

746
01:25:03.836 --> 01:25:07.419
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

747
01:25:21.228 --> 01:25:22.723
Vince!

748
01:25:51.008 --> 01:25:52.171
Take the wheel.

749
01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.965
- What do you mean?
- Put your foot on the gas!

750
01:25:55.722 --> 01:25:58.010
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

751
01:25:58.099 --> 01:25:59.344
Okay!

752
01:26:02.729 --> 01:26:05.813
- Come on. Keep it steady.
- I got it!

753
01:26:07.358 --> 01:26:09.315
All right, hold on, Vince.

754
01:26:10.111 --> 01:26:13.029
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

755
01:26:13.114 --> 01:26:14.395
All right.

756
01:26:15.241 --> 01:26:17.400
- Closer.
- I'm moving in.

757
01:26:17.785 --> 01:26:19.363
Hold it right there!

758
01:26:20.205 --> 01:26:21.284
Go!

759
01:26:23.458 --> 01:26:26.031
You got to hang in here with me now!

760
01:26:26.127 --> 01:26:28.286
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

761
01:26:28.379 --> 01:26:30.538
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

762
01:26:34.511 --> 01:26:37.084
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

763
01:26:37.889 --> 01:26:40.214
Vince, don't let go!

764
01:26:44.437 --> 01:26:46.513
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

765
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:53.778
Mia, get closer! Come on.

766
01:26:53.864 --> 01:26:55.737
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

767
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:25.091
Shit.

768
01:27:28.732 --> 01:27:32.267
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

769
01:27:35.531 --> 01:27:37.155
- Watch her.
- I got her.

770
01:27:38.075 --> 01:27:40.613
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

771
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:47.957
If he doesn't get to an ambulance
in 10 minutes, he's dead.

772
01:27:48.043 --> 01:27:50.499
- Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up.
- I got it.

773
01:27:56.427 --> 01:27:59.381
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

774
01:27:59.596 --> 01:28:02.052
I'm off-duty MAPD.

775
01:28:02.182 --> 01:28:04.970
I need a life flight roll out right away.

776
01:28:06.103 --> 01:28:10.397
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

777
01:28:10.941 --> 01:28:13.978
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age.

778
01:28:14.069 --> 01:28:16.643
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

779
01:28:16.822 --> 01:28:20.571
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm
with arterial bleeding.

780
01:28:20.659 --> 01:28:25.037
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

781
01:28:26.957 --> 01:28:28.867
Yeah, he's going into shock!

782
01:30:08.935 --> 01:30:10.845
Dom, put the gun down now!

783
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.267
- Move your car.
- No bullshit!

784
01:30:15.358 --> 01:30:17.814
Put it down now! No more running!

785
01:30:17.944 --> 01:30:19.487
I'm not running!

786
01:30:22.616 --> 01:30:25.023
- Where's Leon and Letty?
- They're long gone!

787
01:30:25.118 --> 01:30:28.155
Then it's over.
I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

788
01:30:28.246 --> 01:30:31.164
- Put the gun down. I swear to God!
- You are the cop!

789
01:30:31.249 --> 01:30:32.660
You're a cop!

790
01:30:34.253 --> 01:30:37.622
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

791
01:30:37.714 --> 01:30:40.585
- I'm all the kid's got.
- I'll call in the plates.

792
01:30:40.676 --> 01:30:44.376
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

793
01:30:44.555 --> 01:30:48.006
- Move your car.
- Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

794
01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.849
Mia, stay out of it!

795
01:30:55.399 --> 01:30:58.602
Dominic, I am so sorry.

796
01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:01.192
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

797
01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:05.527
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

798
01:31:05.617 --> 01:31:08.369
What were you thinking, man?

799
01:31:08.454 --> 01:31:10.945
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

800
01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.949
I'm scared!

801
01:31:13.042 --> 01:31:16.126
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

802
01:31:20.674 --> 01:31:22.169
Dom!

803
01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.357
Jesse!

804
01:31:42.446 --> 01:31:43.941
No, Jesse!

805
01:31:58.671 --> 01:32:00.296
No, Dom, no!

806
01:34:55.182 --> 01:34:58.551
Call 911. You call 911!

807
01:35:33.388 --> 01:35:36.139
I used to drag here back in high school.

808
01:35:36.849 --> 01:35:41.013
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

809
01:35:42.188 --> 01:35:44.810
On green, I'm going for it.

810
01:38:19.388 --> 01:38:21.630
That's not what I had in mind.

811
01:39:08.188 --> 01:39:10.097
You know what you're doing?

812
01:39:10.565 --> 01:39:12.641
I owe you a 10-second car.

813
01:39:13.305 --> 01:39:19.796
