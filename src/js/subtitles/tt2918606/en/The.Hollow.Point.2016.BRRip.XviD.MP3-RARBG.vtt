1
00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.718
Hey, Ken.

2
00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.346
- What's up?
- You're getting skinnier on me.

3
00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.027
Yeah.

4
00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.320
Where's my money?

5
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.590
Your friend was late four hours last week.

6
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.226
And he's late again today.

7
00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.480
I see... go have a talk with him.

8
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.371
The talk is happening right now.

9
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.657
You're going nowhere
until Clive gets here.

10
00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.291
<i># Yeah, the kids call him Conejo #</i>

11
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.727
<i># 'Cause he was fast on his feet #</i>

12
00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:32.265
<i># And he was quick with his fists
If he had trouble in the streets #</i>

13
00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.534
<i># But when his old man
would hit the bottle #</i>

14
00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.919
<i># He'd kick Conejo's ass #</i>

15
00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.708
<i># And with a wounded heart
Conejo swore he'd outrun his past #</i>

16
00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.244
<i># Run, Conejo, run #</i>

17
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.139
Never seen no speed limit on this road,
Sheriff Kilbaught, so I...

18
00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.091
so I made a... a modest estimate.

19
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.481
Never been anything modest
about your modesty, Clive.

20
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.950
This truck don't go
a mile over 50, Sheriff.

21
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.085
Now, you were driving
a different truck this morning.

22
00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.522
I've been watching you the last
few weeks, driving back and forth,

23
00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:32.458
back and forth, back and forth.

24
00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.662
Now, we both know there ain't nothing in
this town worth taking a second look at.

25
00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.531
Yeah. That against the law now, Sheriff?

26
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.233
Okay, come on, out.

27
00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:44.537
Even your mama thinks
you're a piece of shit.

28
00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.424
You don't belong here.

29
00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:52.679
You got me thinking.

30
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.582
Two trucks...
hauling the same junk in the same day?

31
00:04:56.662 --> 00:05:00.486
What's garbage like you doing with garbage
like this? Come on, open her up.

32
00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:05.125
It's the only job I can get, seeing as
how people are so damn discriminant...

33
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.827
against those who have paid their dues.

34
00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:11.080
Discriminant? Hell of a word there, Clive.

35
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.422
But it ain't your word.

36
00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:16.803
What did you do with the other truck, huh?

37
00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:19.173
You're gonna start walking...

38
00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.024
Hey.

39
00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.098
What you got there, boy?
You spit that out.

40
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.184
Spit it out! You spit that out!

41
00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:35.355
Huh? Come on, get up. Get up!

42
00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:55.324
What?

43
00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.306
Is it the stew-maker?

44
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.995
Hear the cartel has a guy,
dissolves people in acid,

45
00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:19.400
puts them in a barrel, makes them soup.

46
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.370
Is that who I'm waiting for?

47
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.205
Is it you?

48
00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:29.142
My job is to place a call at 7:30.

49
00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.777
And if you don't make the call?

50
00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:34.180
You get put on a list.

51
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.217
And if you get put on the list...

52
00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.936
it's unfortunate.

53
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:45.726
But if Clive isn't here
in the next 15 minutes...

54
00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:50.964
soon enough,
I'll be talking to a dead man.

55
00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.800
Well...

56
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.904
If I'm already dead...

57
00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.931
You're a dead man!

58
00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:01.935
You ain't doing too good a job
at staying gone.

59
00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:05.237
You know, sometimes...

60
00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:08.674
I can't get through an entire day
without hearing all kinds of rumors

61
00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.877
getting told about you.

62
00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.812
Like what?

63
00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.947
I don't know.

64
00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:18.601
One of my favorite ones is the one about
you getting murdered on Indian Ridge.

65
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:21.704
Well, they have the decency
to bury me, at least?

66
00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:30.162
Can't say. Don't really keep track
of the rumors I didn't start.

67
00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:33.482
Got any rumors about me
being made sheriff?

68
00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:40.506
Sheriff Kilbaught ain't gonna
like you coming back.

69
00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:43.442
Well, he's gonna find
he ain't got much room to argue.

70
00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:46.029
Maybe I don't like you coming back.

71
00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.122
You know I always told you,
you deserve better than this.

72
00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.166
Marla.

73
00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:09.002
Welcome home, Wallace.

74
00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.305
Hey, how come that thing
always stayed broken?

75
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.003
Don't got a phone connection
at my ma's old house anymore.

76
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.141
Marla was good
about looking after it, but...

77
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.960
Use that one.

78
00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:58.150
You ever hear anything
about me getting murdered?

79
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.553
Yes, sir, I believe I have.

80
00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.055
- They shot you in the throat.
- Throat?

81
00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:04.524
- Yeah.
- No kidding?

82
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.819
Heard you was mouthing off
like you used to, and...

83
00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.963
somebody just shot you
right there how you stood.

84
00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:14.751
Well, Jerry, ain't you gonna
welcome me back from the dead?

85
00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.007
Asshole.

86
00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.883
Armor-piercing.

87
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:34.487
- They call them "cop killers."
- Why is that?

88
00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.706
On account of them killing cops.

89
00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:43.664
Do you need it for, like, DNA?

90
00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.700
Forensics lab is two weeks
and 150 miles away

91
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.172
from giving half a shit about this town.
Bet you no one's told you that.

92
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.707
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:58.833
Yep, don't let that
worry you none too much.

94
00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:03.983
<i>You know, are you lonely for a car?
I get lonely when I don't have a car.</i>

95
00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:08.598
<i>But I'm not lonely anymore, 'cause at
Diaz Motors I've got plenty of friends.</i>

96
00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:27.121
You don't got to knock.
I know what you're after.

97
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.792
Come on in.

98
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.995
Yeah?

99
00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:43.157
You are scared shitless.

100
00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.392
What did you know about that?

101
00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:49.729
There's just the matter of this job
you come to do.

102
00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:55.234
Six reported incidences of harassing
motorists, two with brutality.

103
00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:58.538
Then there's you, crossing the line.

104
00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:01.440
No, that ain't it.

105
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.378
It's been a long time coming, Leland,
the way you've been running things.

106
00:12:06.758 --> 00:12:08.781
If you ain't scared
of what needs to be done,

107
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.150
then you ain't got no clue
why you're here.

108
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.653
I got sent here to replace you.

109
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.355
Maybe a day too late,
but replace you nonetheless.

110
00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:20.323
You got sent here because
it's your punishment, Wallace.

111
00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:23.045
Taking your statement, is all.

112
00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.564
You fetch me some water, would you?

113
00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.019
Hmm?

114
00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:36.781
Hm. You have no idea what that...

115
00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:40.740
that boy Clive was threatening to bring.

116
00:12:42.894 --> 00:12:46.051
These horrible people
doing immoral things,

117
00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:47.961
and now they're creeping
across the border,

118
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:52.174
threatening to make
the boogeyman a real thing.

119
00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:57.062
It's enough to give you a good start.

120
00:12:57.142 --> 00:13:01.184
It'll make you want to wait
for all the bad things to come get you.

121
00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:12.378
I don't regret what happened.

122
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:17.016
Takes a willing hand
to punish horrible men.

123
00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:21.764
They're building a case, Le.
They're gonna lock you away.

124
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.719
You come here to get my statement? Huh?

125
00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:34.001
Expecting me to... say I'm innocent?

126
00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:39.404
I was gonna make that boy walk.
I was gonna put him on that back road.

127
00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:42.141
Leave him to the boogeyman
to rip him apart,

128
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:46.979
or return him to whatever
ungodly dirt he came from.

129
00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.833
And if the road couldn't do it...

130
00:13:56.135 --> 00:14:00.597
I'd do it myself, 'cause sometimes
that's just what you got to do.

131
00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:04.331
Well, you've done enough.

132
00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:11.104
Ah.

133
00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:23.683
Welcome home, Wallace.

134
00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.106
Asshole.

135
00:14:36.708 --> 00:14:38.860
<i>Ken Mersey didn't go home last night.</i>

136
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.734
<i>He's been reported missing this morning.</i>

137
00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:51.477
Boys need stupid things to do.

138
00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:54.079
That's how their mamas wire them.

139
00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:56.713
Well, his mama wasn't no electrician.

140
00:14:58.263 --> 00:15:00.520
Explains the dim bulb.

141
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.239
It's not like you to be so funny so early.

142
00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.226
Well...

143
00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:10.947
I always figured Ken Mersey liked you
a whole lot more than you liked him.

144
00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:13.198
Maybe he just don't want to show his face.

145
00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:16.335
He's missing, I'm worried. It doesn't
have to be so black-and-white, Lilly.

146
00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.688
For fuck's sake.

147
00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.008
All I'm saying is that...

148
00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:25.978
maybe he's gone
because he wants to be gone.

149
00:15:26.658 --> 00:15:28.881
This ain't hardly about Ken, is it?

150
00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.461
This is about Wallace coming back.

151
00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.103
Hey, do you want to take care of this?

152
00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:40.227
Oh, Jerry, you're just aching
for coffee, aren't you?

153
00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.630
Here.

154
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.299
Drink up. There's plenty more.

155
00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.001
That's an awful shame about Kilbaught.

156
00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:53.125
Old Sheriff Kilbaught is a violent dinosaur
going the way of his kind.

157
00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:56.207
- How about yourself?
- I'm good on coffee.

158
00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:03.479
Spent a good five months figuring out
smuggling routes up in Indian Ridge.

159
00:16:07.085 --> 00:16:11.544
Kept on hearing about...
peculiarities and such.

160
00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:17.451
Catapults and back-alley breast implants.

161
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:21.787
Even heard about a submarine once,

162
00:16:21.867 --> 00:16:25.658
somebody took the time to build
by hand in their garage.

163
00:16:30.476 --> 00:16:32.181
Mm.

164
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.737
And these brass bastards...

165
00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:40.740
they buy fear and panic...

166
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.178
which makes them a whole lot
cleaner than money.

167
00:16:46.258 --> 00:16:49.648
You can speculate all you want
about where they came from...

168
00:16:49.728 --> 00:16:53.819
or where they're going,
but the real concern here is,

169
00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:57.928
what's gonna happen if this bullet
don't make its destination.

170
00:16:58.437 --> 00:17:00.225
So...

171
00:17:00.305 --> 00:17:02.812
you found just the one?

172
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.012
Shit.

173
00:18:12.844 --> 00:18:15.167
You still alive?

174
00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:24.794
Someone's calling looking
to speak with the sheriff!

175
00:18:29.628 --> 00:18:32.252
He sure rushed my gate in a hurry.

176
00:18:33.632 --> 00:18:35.420
I called you because the plates came back.

177
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.891
They were registered to a used car lot
over in your jurisdiction.

178
00:18:38.971 --> 00:18:41.093
Diaz Classics?

179
00:18:41.173 --> 00:18:44.263
Yeah. Showed up as stolen.

180
00:18:44.843 --> 00:18:47.499
I called it in. It took 40 minutes.

181
00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:49.668
Anyway, they chased him
all the way out to the 24,

182
00:18:49.748 --> 00:18:52.504
lost him out there on a back road
before your guy went in after him.

183
00:18:52.584 --> 00:18:54.473
What guy?

184
00:18:54.553 --> 00:18:58.110
I don't know. I couldn't flag him,
but I saw him. I saw the tan uniform.

185
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.313
I figured I'd just call your partner
in the morning and check in.

186
00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:03.415
Was me and the old man.

187
00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:06.151
As of this morning, got to be just me.

188
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:10.622
<i>Dispatch, we have a code 32
off Carrion Road.</i>

189
00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:13.375
<i>Burning pretty good, by the smell of it.</i>

190
00:19:17.809 --> 00:19:20.416
<i>I think I found us Ken Mersey.</i>

191
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.287
What the hell happened to you, Ken?

192
00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:18.307
Where'd you get off to?

193
00:20:30.449 --> 00:20:32.154
Shit.

194
00:20:40.826 --> 00:20:42.447
Well, that's everyone that's come in.

195
00:20:42.527 --> 00:20:46.919
Closest thing to a Molotov cocktail these
folks have seen is a broken air conditioner.

196
00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:50.589
Sorry about that, Deputy.
But I don't believe your friend is here.

197
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:52.925
Didn't say he was a friend.

198
00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:55.511
And it's Sheriff.

199
00:20:59.544 --> 00:21:01.968
Is Ken in there?

200
00:21:03.048 --> 00:21:05.320
Is he okay?

201
00:21:09.588 --> 00:21:12.295
Don't give me that look, Wallace.

202
00:21:15.861 --> 00:21:18.150
Surprising, is all.

203
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.187
Ken Mersey is a good man.

204
00:21:22.767 --> 00:21:24.973
He looks after me.

205
00:21:33.945 --> 00:21:36.636
Oh, Wallace, stop it.

206
00:21:37.816 --> 00:21:40.266
What do you know about the truck?

207
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.411
He bought it. He told me
to fix it up and sell it to Shep.

208
00:21:46.591 --> 00:21:49.314
You know he was smuggling ammunitions
across the border in that truck?

209
00:21:49.394 --> 00:21:51.850
- That's a lie.
- Well, whatever he ain't telling you

210
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.920
got him in trouble last night,
got him confronted.

211
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.822
By who?

212
00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:59.526
Still sorting that out.

213
00:22:01.006 --> 00:22:03.462
But whoever that may be...

214
00:22:03.942 --> 00:22:07.532
I ain't gonna tell you that Ken Mersey don't
got his own consequences coming to him.

215
00:22:07.612 --> 00:22:10.052
Ah, fuck.

216
00:22:17.122 --> 00:22:19.411
You bring him home, Wallace.

217
00:23:37.369 --> 00:23:40.268
<i># Y tú que te creías #</i>

218
00:23:40.348 --> 00:23:45.130
<i># El rey de todo el mundo #</i>

219
00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:49.657
<i># Y tú que nunca fuiste #</i>

220
00:23:49.737 --> 00:23:53.524

221
00:23:55.494 --> 00:23:58.434

222
00:23:58.514 --> 00:24:01.334
<i># De todo te reías #</i>

223
00:24:01.414 --> 00:24:03.114
<i># Hoy imploras... ##</i>

224
00:24:03.194 --> 00:24:06.484
They got your commercial
on TV up in Indian Ridge.

225
00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:10.122
It's 4:00 in the morning,
but it's TV nonetheless.

226
00:24:11.202 --> 00:24:13.525
You trick-or-treating?

227
00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:17.162
Was wondering if you knew anything
about Ken Mersey going missing.

228
00:24:17.242 --> 00:24:19.664
Yeah, what kind of trouble he got?

229
00:24:19.744 --> 00:24:22.536
The considerable kind, I guess.

230
00:24:24.516 --> 00:24:26.405
Ooh.

231
00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:30.815
Really taking yourself seriously
in that uniform, ain't you?

232
00:24:31.222 --> 00:24:34.679
Don't mind going after
an old drinking buddy like that?

233
00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:37.782
As far as I can see, he's under arrest.

234
00:24:37.862 --> 00:24:40.035
If he's still alive.

235
00:24:47.906 --> 00:24:50.126
How do you take your coffee?

236
00:24:51.176 --> 00:24:53.248
I don't.

237
00:25:01.719 --> 00:25:03.491
Well...

238
00:25:09.427 --> 00:25:11.784
No sales being had.

239
00:25:12.764 --> 00:25:16.655
No maintenance or repairs being had.

240
00:25:17.235 --> 00:25:19.692
It's just a whole lot of nothing.

241
00:25:21.022 --> 00:25:23.795
I haven't had a real need
for Ken in the garage.

242
00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:27.398
- What about the stolen truck?
- Trucks.

243
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.102
He took them with.

244
00:25:31.182 --> 00:25:35.299
He didn't say anything. He just... went.

245
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.243
That don't sound like him.

246
00:25:38.323 --> 00:25:41.547
People have a way
of changing on you, I guess.

247
00:25:42.027 --> 00:25:44.046
I guess.

248
00:25:45.597 --> 00:25:48.287
I want the trucks back.
That's why I only reported one.

249
00:25:48.367 --> 00:25:50.791
I wanted him to know, you know?

250
00:25:52.771 --> 00:25:57.162
I didn't really want Ken
to get into any sort of trouble,

251
00:25:57.242 --> 00:25:59.278
knowing his mama and all.

252
00:25:59.978 --> 00:26:03.868
Ken was cutting armor-piercing slugs
into scrap engine parts

253
00:26:03.948 --> 00:26:06.172
not 20 feet from where you're sitting.

254
00:26:07.252 --> 00:26:10.141
Well, if he was doing any of the sort,
it wasn't in my garage.

255
00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:14.386
There's no other place in town
suited for that kind of... activity.

256
00:26:14.876 --> 00:26:18.687
First off, how about his garage?

257
00:26:19.597 --> 00:26:24.028
- Ken opened his own shop?
- Always get a ribbon for trying.

258
00:26:27.739 --> 00:26:29.445
Asshole.

259
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.093
You're good right there, Wallace.

260
00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:03.214
What'd you get yourself into, Kenny?

261
00:29:03.294 --> 00:29:08.671
I took 250,000 to leave this place...

262
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:12.391
to not belong in here...

263
00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:15.962
for just... for just one night.

264
00:29:17.642 --> 00:29:20.298
It kicks a good bit of life into you.

265
00:29:20.378 --> 00:29:22.734
That cousin of yours...

266
00:29:22.814 --> 00:29:25.170
he's laid out on a slab.

267
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.697
Kilbaught took his head clean off,
and you ain't too far behind.

268
00:29:31.155 --> 00:29:33.906
I want to know where the bullets are
coming from and who struck the deal.

269
00:29:33.986 --> 00:29:37.282
I want names, names I can hunt down
and put away this side of the border.

270
00:29:37.362 --> 00:29:40.585
The cartel won't take this lightly.
They'll send someone.

271
00:29:40.665 --> 00:29:44.324
What's coming, it ain't some butcher.

272
00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:50.035
It's punishment.
You can't stop a thing like that.

273
00:29:50.808 --> 00:29:52.897
All that money you took can't buy the fact

274
00:29:52.977 --> 00:29:56.254
that now you got them
coming after Marla too.

275
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.040
She didn't know.

276
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.009
They won't care.

277
00:30:05.089 --> 00:30:07.547
I only took my cut!

278
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.526
What's this?

279
00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:38.059
Oh, you chicken shit, just go.

280
00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.438
Fuck me.

281
00:33:27.325 --> 00:33:29.164
Kenny.

282
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.869
Fuck.

283
00:33:59.023 --> 00:34:02.714
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

284
00:35:46.998 --> 00:35:49.471
What the hell?

285
00:35:51.202 --> 00:35:53.074
Wallace?

286
00:35:54.405 --> 00:35:55.927
Wallace!

287
00:35:56.007 --> 00:35:57.854
Wallace.

288
00:35:59.076 --> 00:36:01.166
Hey, Wallace.

289
00:36:01.946 --> 00:36:05.838
What the hell happened to you, son? Huh?

290
00:36:07.485 --> 00:36:11.742
- Who did this to you, boy?
- When it happens... when it stops...

291
00:36:11.822 --> 00:36:14.478
You can't feel it. It don't hurt.

292
00:36:14.558 --> 00:36:16.931
We got to get you some...

293
00:36:20.164 --> 00:36:23.481
Come on, Wallace.
Come on, you're gonna be okay.

294
00:36:51.896 --> 00:36:53.968
How does that feel?

295
00:36:57.451 --> 00:36:59.758
About as good as it looks.

296
00:37:06.877 --> 00:37:09.734
If we fetch it, we can re-attach it.

297
00:37:10.114 --> 00:37:14.322
They do... do that, right?

298
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:20.474
Well, you got one of two options.

299
00:37:20.554 --> 00:37:23.441
Get used to it, or don't look at it.

300
00:37:24.695 --> 00:37:27.485
- Hear that?
- What?

301
00:37:27.565 --> 00:37:31.089
That'd be me, slow-clapping you...

302
00:37:31.669 --> 00:37:34.660
if my clapping hand was still with us.

303
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.830
Could have been a lot worse on you.

304
00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.432
I saw your friend
when they brought him in.

305
00:37:41.512 --> 00:37:43.569
He ain't my friend.

306
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.144
Way you saw him...

307
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.476
Kilbaught was right about people like him

308
00:37:52.556 --> 00:37:55.248
bringing hell up into this town.

309
00:37:57.428 --> 00:38:01.249
The way I see it, Ken Mersey
got what was coming to him.

310
00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:05.601
- Getting his head cut off the way...
- You said you were gonna bring him home.

311
00:38:07.805 --> 00:38:11.028
- Marla...
- That's what you said to me, Wallace.

312
00:38:11.108 --> 00:38:14.133
Well, the hell with him.
I know what I said.

313
00:38:15.413 --> 00:38:18.071
There was nothing to bring home.

314
00:38:20.751 --> 00:38:23.057
You're such a fuck.

315
00:39:02.426 --> 00:39:05.412
Shepard Diaz.

316
00:39:05.762 --> 00:39:10.541
History of misconduct, brutality,
or any badges with that name?

317
00:39:35.526 --> 00:39:37.431
Hang on.

318
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:42.670
Shoot.

319
00:39:44.635 --> 00:39:47.658
Yep. Simon, yep.

320
00:39:47.938 --> 00:39:50.528
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

321
00:39:51.208 --> 00:39:57.060
Well, does the system make any note
of tattoos or distinct markings and such?

322
00:40:00.918 --> 00:40:02.874
The neck.

323
00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:07.179
Yeah.

324
00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:10.965
Last known address?

325
00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:34.072
Wallace, I need to talk.

326
00:40:34.752 --> 00:40:38.159
Think I've done more than enough
of that with you today.

327
00:40:44.795 --> 00:40:48.235
I'm sorry for snapping at you
back at the hospital.

328
00:40:50.634 --> 00:40:53.740
- Shit.
- Wallace...

329
00:40:55.973 --> 00:40:58.414
You should be back in that bed.

330
00:41:00.611 --> 00:41:03.065
You ran off without these.

331
00:41:05.082 --> 00:41:07.522
I don't want you to do this.

332
00:41:15.025 --> 00:41:18.883
- It's not your job to punish me like this.
- I ain't punishing.

333
00:41:19.263 --> 00:41:21.886
Going out there
and getting yourself killed?

334
00:41:22.266 --> 00:41:24.593
Yeah, what are you calling that?

335
00:41:27.838 --> 00:41:30.247
Please don't do this.

336
00:41:41.218 --> 00:41:43.841
You're all I got left.

337
00:41:48.225 --> 00:41:52.051
Wasn't too good at taking you
away from this place, was I?

338
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:56.622
- No.
- Mm.

339
00:41:58.402 --> 00:42:02.277
You are tired, busted,
and hurt, is what you are.

340
00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.270
Don't be mad.

341
00:42:14.318 --> 00:42:17.444
Got to thinking about
that stolen jalopy of yours,

342
00:42:17.524 --> 00:42:20.761
which got me thinking about your ex-wife.

343
00:42:20.891 --> 00:42:23.851
Hm? Hm.

344
00:42:24.862 --> 00:42:27.151
I couldn't hold on either, Shep.
Never could.

345
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:30.085
And I was captivated by my bride.

346
00:42:31.335 --> 00:42:34.593
I just couldn't tell
which color was what on her.

347
00:42:35.673 --> 00:42:38.129
Didn't know why I never did bother.

348
00:42:38.909 --> 00:42:42.834
Anyway, she got to walking out on me.

349
00:42:45.766 --> 00:42:49.450
Been gone more years now
than we was actually together.

350
00:42:51.972 --> 00:42:53.728
No.

351
00:42:54.958 --> 00:42:57.206
You can't win a woman back. That's...

352
00:42:57.286 --> 00:43:00.051
something ugly beasts like you
and me do not get to do.

353
00:43:00.131 --> 00:43:02.021
- Oh, go fuck yourself, Le.
- Hey!

354
00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:04.955
- Fuck you, fuck you.
- Hold on there a second.

355
00:43:05.035 --> 00:43:08.659
Don't you go dwelling in dignity.
Does not suit you.

356
00:43:08.739 --> 00:43:11.214
Doesn't suit us.

357
00:43:12.509 --> 00:43:15.967
She's half your worth, and she's gone.

358
00:43:17.247 --> 00:43:20.437
You haven't sold a car
on that lot for ages.

359
00:43:20.517 --> 00:43:24.141
You got a face like a thumb,
and you stuck it on a TV commercial.

360
00:43:24.221 --> 00:43:27.010
How dare you, hmm?

361
00:43:29.059 --> 00:43:33.272
I do must ask myself, how the hell
do you keep this place afloat?

362
00:43:40.704 --> 00:43:44.512
Come on, sit down, Shep. Hmm? Sit.

363
00:43:51.248 --> 00:43:54.605
You are not an unfortunate man.

364
00:43:54.685 --> 00:43:56.974
You're an auspicious parasite,

365
00:43:57.054 --> 00:44:00.935
and I need you to tell me
who's on the other side of that spook.

366
00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.985
You came in with your mind made up.

367
00:44:08.265 --> 00:44:11.123
What the fuck you want me to tell you, Le?

368
00:44:12.703 --> 00:44:14.508
Huh?

369
00:44:16.607 --> 00:44:19.863
- Can't ask you to trust me.
- Well, then don't.

370
00:44:19.943 --> 00:44:22.734
Shame on you.

371
00:44:24.214 --> 00:44:27.106
I had trouble finding the fix for it.

372
00:44:28.886 --> 00:44:31.058
But I found it.

373
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.333
So what's this, then?

374
00:45:38.722 --> 00:45:41.934
It's only ever been three crosses
that I remember.

375
00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.980
Who's the fourth?

376
00:45:48.532 --> 00:45:51.196
Could be the one waiting for me.

377
00:45:52.336 --> 00:45:55.983
"This god-forsaken road
will bury us all somehow."

378
00:45:57.674 --> 00:45:59.980
Was the way Ken said it.

379
00:46:12.923 --> 00:46:15.464
You look good with that promotion on you.

380
00:46:17.294 --> 00:46:20.250
You already got made sheriff.
You got what you wanted.

381
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.487
- Oh, yeah.
- What about me, huh?

382
00:46:23.567 --> 00:46:27.775
Wasn't so much a promotion,
like I said it was.

383
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.329
Why wasn't I good enough?

384
00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:34.816
Good enough for you to stay?

385
00:46:44.088 --> 00:46:45.946
Can't...

386
00:47:00.437 --> 00:47:02.660
So how much money he take?

387
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.762
Well, enough, I guess.

388
00:47:04.842 --> 00:47:07.265
You sound like you really care.

389
00:47:07.995 --> 00:47:10.137
They don't care about the money neither.

390
00:47:10.217 --> 00:47:14.613
They just got to decide if his death
is enough. Simple as that.

391
00:47:15.218 --> 00:47:18.442
If they can find Ken
in the middle of a back road,

392
00:47:18.522 --> 00:47:21.312
they're sure as hell are gonna find you.

393
00:47:22.492 --> 00:47:24.915
I've seen the man who killed him.

394
00:47:25.495 --> 00:47:26.850
I know his name, I know where he is.

395
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:30.125
And what are you gonna do?
You can't even write him a ticket.

396
00:47:31.335 --> 00:47:35.659
Kilbaught, he knew.
There's no arresting anyone.

397
00:47:36.139 --> 00:47:38.345
Not anymore.

398
00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:43.267
I need a ride.

399
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.872
Up here, on the left.

400
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.113
You know you don't got to go.

401
00:48:29.493 --> 00:48:31.849
Call it a good cause, then.

402
00:48:32.529 --> 00:48:36.023
The only good cause you'll ever have
is listening to me.

403
00:48:38.836 --> 00:48:40.909
We could go.

404
00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:46.578
Keep driving.

405
00:48:48.578 --> 00:48:50.817
I'd really like that.

406
00:49:31.891 --> 00:49:33.611
Oh, fuck!

407
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:37.288
Get back, get back!

408
00:49:37.895 --> 00:49:39.916
Go on, put it down.

409
00:49:39.996 --> 00:49:43.671
That girl behind you ain't gonna like you
with no pecker. Put the fucking gun down.

410
00:49:47.337 --> 00:49:49.767
Who the fuck are you?

411
00:49:49.907 --> 00:49:52.176
Who the fuck are you?

412
00:49:52.576 --> 00:49:55.413
I'm the man looking for Samuel Gibbons.

413
00:49:56.713 --> 00:49:58.737
That'd be me.

414
00:50:00.017 --> 00:50:01.438
Is this you hiding him? Huh?

415
00:50:01.518 --> 00:50:05.442
Look, look, I don't know much,
but just take whatever you want and go.

416
00:50:05.522 --> 00:50:07.685
Shut up!

417
00:50:08.325 --> 00:50:12.416
- You're a cop?
- I work for county, same as you.

418
00:50:12.596 --> 00:50:15.819
Whatever the issue is here,
you and I, we can sort it out.

419
00:50:15.899 --> 00:50:18.788
- We can understand each other.
- How is it that they own you?

420
00:50:18.868 --> 00:50:21.624
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know they own you.

421
00:50:21.704 --> 00:50:25.613
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- You son of a bitch, I know they do!

422
00:50:25.693 --> 00:50:28.918
- Stop it! Stop it! Oh, my God!
- You're gonna take me to him!

423
00:50:28.998 --> 00:50:31.668
Now we're gonna make a liar out of you.

424
00:50:31.748 --> 00:50:34.071
Why are you helping him?

425
00:50:34.751 --> 00:50:37.023
Take me to him!

426
00:50:40.624 --> 00:50:43.013
You gonna take me to him now?

427
00:50:43.493 --> 00:50:45.933
I don't know what you want me tell you.
I don't know!

428
00:50:46.013 --> 00:50:47.584
They're good at making threats.

429
00:50:47.664 --> 00:50:49.686
- Get the fuck away from him!
- Get back.

430
00:50:49.766 --> 00:50:51.555
- Just stop!
- They're efficient

431
00:50:51.635 --> 00:50:53.597
at getting their points understood.

432
00:50:53.837 --> 00:50:56.926
So maybe you had a gun held to your head.

433
00:50:57.006 --> 00:51:00.834
- But I bet she ain't had a gun held to hers.
- No, stop it! You stop it, goddamn it.

434
00:51:00.914 --> 00:51:04.084
No, please, please.
Stop, goddamn it, please.

435
00:51:04.214 --> 00:51:06.773
Stop, stop. No.

436
00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:18.215
- Stop him.
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

437
00:51:18.295 --> 00:51:22.953
What happens to her is because of you.
Now, you tell me where he is!

438
00:51:23.033 --> 00:51:26.356
I swear to God,
I don't know what you fucking mean.

439
00:51:30.674 --> 00:51:32.929
You know what he done.

440
00:51:33.009 --> 00:51:35.448
And that don't make you
any better than him.

441
00:51:50.727 --> 00:51:52.966
Oh, my God.

442
00:51:54.864 --> 00:51:57.304
Is that the guy who killed Ken?

443
00:52:01.104 --> 00:52:03.143
I don't know.

444
00:52:06.776 --> 00:52:10.308
- I was sure that he...
- You were gonna kill him anyway?

445
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:16.475
What is it with you, Wallace?

446
00:52:18.855 --> 00:52:21.788
You find the wrong guy,
and then you won't stop.

447
00:52:22.058 --> 00:52:25.565
It ain't making you any better
than what you're chasing after.

448
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.209
Marla, wait.

449
00:53:11.374 --> 00:53:13.704
What a pair, huh?

450
00:53:14.478 --> 00:53:16.216
Yeah.

451
00:53:19.916 --> 00:53:23.941
What's that you said about good
people disappearing? Was that...

452
00:53:24.521 --> 00:53:28.245
'cause there's no protecting them?
Or you fail to protect them?

453
00:53:28.325 --> 00:53:30.981
Or you scare them away?

454
00:53:31.061 --> 00:53:33.283
One of those.

455
00:53:33.963 --> 00:53:36.069
All of those.

456
00:53:40.103 --> 00:53:42.325
Nearly killed an innocent man.

457
00:53:42.405 --> 00:53:44.461
Well, there's no getting him,

458
00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:46.798
the man you're after.

459
00:53:48.378 --> 00:53:50.333
Could be anybody.

460
00:53:50.413 --> 00:53:53.470
Because incidentally...

461
00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:55.705
he is anybody.

462
00:53:55.785 --> 00:53:57.974
Monsters hide in plain sight.

463
00:53:58.054 --> 00:54:02.079
And once you put enough money in a man's
hands, he'll do almost whatever you want,

464
00:54:02.159 --> 00:54:06.335
and you can turn him
into whatever you need him to be.

465
00:54:07.931 --> 00:54:11.293
Just like these boogeymen
on the back roads.

466
00:54:11.968 --> 00:54:14.207
They're demons.

467
00:54:16.573 --> 00:54:19.963
And "demons" is only a way
of calling their illness.

468
00:54:20.243 --> 00:54:23.266
- Ahh.
- What's there to stop it, then?

469
00:54:23.746 --> 00:54:27.421
You go after the illness itself.

470
00:54:29.286 --> 00:54:31.374
Crumpled under the vest?

471
00:54:31.454 --> 00:54:35.212
Señor Diaz selling them crap.
They're after Shep.

472
00:54:36.292 --> 00:54:41.625
So Shep was using Ken to smuggle
shitty bullets into Mexico? Huh.

473
00:54:45.802 --> 00:54:47.791
Would you do it?

474
00:54:47.871 --> 00:54:52.016
Make a go at it for 250,000?
That don't seem enough.

475
00:54:53.643 --> 00:54:55.665
No, I wouldn't.

476
00:54:55.745 --> 00:54:58.418
I wouldn't run if I knew I couldn't.

477
00:55:01.084 --> 00:55:03.541
I'd burrow down.

478
00:55:04.821 --> 00:55:06.403
Where?

479
00:56:31.941 --> 00:56:35.089
Put him on the back road,
let the back road take him?

480
00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:38.735
What's different, then? What's changed?

481
00:56:38.815 --> 00:56:42.372
Shep owes your friend Ken Mersey a death.

482
00:56:42.452 --> 00:56:47.498
Now, he'll pay for it,
and he'll pay for it right, to us.

483
00:56:48.691 --> 00:56:52.815
- You're making an arrest?
- That's why you're here.

484
00:56:52.895 --> 00:56:56.375
Helping restore me to the man I once was.

485
00:56:57.767 --> 00:57:00.033
He wasn't my friend.

486
00:57:01.538 --> 00:57:03.159
This guy, you sure he's here?

487
00:57:03.239 --> 00:57:06.947
Asshole showed me a wire receipt
just before he shot me.

488
00:57:11.014 --> 00:57:13.788
Hey, stupid! Come on out!
We know you're in there!

489
00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:38.134
Oh, shit! He's under the house!

490
00:57:46.149 --> 00:57:47.740
You gonna shoot?

491
00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.097
I was thinking about it, yeah.

492
00:57:59.929 --> 00:58:01.618
Fuck.

493
00:58:01.698 --> 00:58:04.003
Put it down, Shep!

494
00:58:26.072 --> 00:58:29.145
Wallace! Wallace!

495
00:58:59.589 --> 00:59:01.411
Oh, shit.

496
00:59:06.512 --> 00:59:09.303
It's okay. It's okay.

497
00:59:10.933 --> 00:59:12.823
Easy.

498
00:59:13.503 --> 00:59:18.161
So... that hovel you've been squatting...

499
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:21.084
what made you think of that place, huh?

500
00:59:22.979 --> 00:59:25.402
Might as well spill it, Shep.

501
00:59:26.382 --> 00:59:30.829
The way you've been going about getting
folks killed is only gonna get me madder.

502
00:59:31.721 --> 00:59:34.478
Some young filly on the side, huh?

503
00:59:35.358 --> 00:59:38.581
- That was a long time ago, Sheriff.
- Sheriff? Oh, no, no.

504
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:43.537
I don't think there's any need for
formalities anymore, not after you shot me.

505
00:59:47.537 --> 00:59:49.893
What the hell you mean by that?

506
00:59:50.673 --> 00:59:52.650
It's only me.

507
01:00:04.587 --> 01:00:06.593
It's a list.

508
01:00:10.026 --> 01:00:14.145
It's a walking, breathing list,
and it will follow you to hell.

509
01:00:14.497 --> 01:00:18.688
The guy they use,
don't know where he's coming from,

510
01:00:18.868 --> 01:00:21.991
but he finds who they tell him to find.

511
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:24.581
He is a butcher.

512
01:00:25.441 --> 01:00:27.864
Won't matter how far I get.

513
01:00:28.444 --> 01:00:30.199
Won't matter where I go.

514
01:00:30.279 --> 01:00:33.770
- They're looking to make an example.
- You've been liquidating assets.

515
01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:38.542
I'm trying to buy my name
off that forsaken list.

516
01:00:40.022 --> 01:00:43.612
I've given them everything
that's not locked down on my lot.

517
01:00:43.692 --> 01:00:48.308
I've given them every buckskin
I've earned, and it's still not enough.

518
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:51.283
Who's wiring your money?

519
01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:58.402
My ex-wife's pension,
few drops in a bucket.

520
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:02.015
All her life amounted to, I guess.

521
01:01:08.718 --> 01:01:11.208
I need Ken Mersey.

522
01:01:11.788 --> 01:01:14.877
If he made it back with that money
and I get my hands on that money,

523
01:01:14.957 --> 01:01:18.948
I promise you, Le, on my life,
I promise you...

524
01:01:19.028 --> 01:01:21.419
I'll make all this go away.

525
01:01:23.099 --> 01:01:25.345
I'll even cut you in.

526
01:01:31.574 --> 01:01:34.765
All you do is let me
walk on out that door.

527
01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:38.127
Let me make it right.

528
01:01:39.182 --> 01:01:41.625
How much you reckon that's worth?

529
01:01:43.085 --> 01:01:45.676
You stay another day in this town...

530
01:01:46.756 --> 01:01:49.647
and you're gonna answer for what you did.

531
01:01:50.827 --> 01:01:54.782
They'll put you in a cement box
for what you did to Clive.

532
01:01:57.133 --> 01:01:59.941
I'm offering you kindness.

533
01:02:09.445 --> 01:02:11.784
I'll mull it over.

534
01:02:18.387 --> 01:02:20.176
Fuck!

535
01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:22.863
So that's you leaving.

536
01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.816
Always known what's going on
in my head, haven't you?

537
01:02:26.896 --> 01:02:29.186
Not by choice.

538
01:02:29.766 --> 01:02:31.654
Yeah, lucky you.

539
01:02:31.734 --> 01:02:34.928
Maybe some day, when luck can afford me.

540
01:02:35.008 --> 01:02:37.094
Yes, ma'am.

541
01:02:38.574 --> 01:02:41.759
You are sweet in small doses.

542
01:02:49.118 --> 01:02:51.157
Your picture.

543
01:02:54.957 --> 01:02:57.182
You deserve better.

544
01:02:59.462 --> 01:03:00.483
Wallace, please don't...

545
01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:03.620
And I'm gonna keep
telling it to you like that...

546
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.855
until you leave.

547
01:03:05.935 --> 01:03:07.925
I can't.

548
01:03:09.605 --> 01:03:11.527
Can't think of something
nice to say to her.

549
01:03:11.607 --> 01:03:14.931
Lilly's a nice girl,
and she was asking for a rosary,

550
01:03:15.011 --> 01:03:19.552
- so I think I should get it.
- Okay. I'll go fetch it.

551
01:03:21.017 --> 01:03:23.323
Wallace, please stay.

552
01:03:25.722 --> 01:03:27.977
This place is...

553
01:03:28.557 --> 01:03:32.484
scorched of life. It's a graveyard.

554
01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.521
Think about leaving.
Do what you got to do, but...

555
01:03:39.402 --> 01:03:42.809
The only person
that's gonna save you is you.

556
01:04:02.258 --> 01:04:05.581
- Sorry, I thought Lilly was in here...
- It's you.

557
01:04:05.661 --> 01:04:07.935
What about me?

558
01:04:13.536 --> 01:04:16.626
Can't remember the last time
I walked around with a picture

559
01:04:16.706 --> 01:04:19.063
of a girl in my wallet.

560
01:04:20.743 --> 01:04:24.834
Well... one that
I didn't love to pieces, anyway.

561
01:04:25.614 --> 01:04:30.398
I don't know. Maybe I'm talking
about a different Ken Mersey.

562
01:04:39.628 --> 01:04:43.971
- I know who you're talking about.
- The Ken Mersey I got to know...

563
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:48.508
couldn't talk about anything
that wasn't you.

564
01:04:59.325 --> 01:05:03.720
His share of the take was always
your share of the take.

565
01:05:23.389 --> 01:05:25.673
I hear he does that.

566
01:06:19.461 --> 01:06:21.834
Always the church girls.

567
01:06:36.946 --> 01:06:38.518
No.

568
01:06:42.218 --> 01:06:43.957
Shit.

569
01:07:00.369 --> 01:07:02.408
Damn it.

570
01:07:08.611 --> 01:07:10.483
Lilly?

571
01:07:18.054 --> 01:07:19.859
Lilly?

572
01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:14.652
Slow down, Harry.
We're stopping all cars tonight.

573
01:09:15.938 --> 01:09:19.094
- What the hell is this?
- What in the hell you think it is?

574
01:09:19.174 --> 01:09:21.797
What the hell is that cock-skin
doing with a gun?

575
01:09:21.877 --> 01:09:25.668
Now, now, now. You're gonna have
to mind your manners around Jerry

576
01:09:25.748 --> 01:09:29.872
- from here on in. He's been deputized.
- What is it you're doing here?

577
01:09:29.952 --> 01:09:34.476
Someone is coming to make something
terrible out of Shep Diaz

578
01:09:34.556 --> 01:09:38.580
and make an example out of this town.
I reckon I'm here doing the same thing.

579
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.952
By protecting Shep
or by getting him killed?

580
01:09:43.432 --> 01:09:45.922
Either way is fine by me.

581
01:09:48.103 --> 01:09:50.827
You are a mean dinosaur, Leland.

582
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:56.899
Congratulations, Harry. Go get your gun.
You've just been deputized.

583
01:09:56.979 --> 01:10:00.760
Here, you take this. And I'll take this.

584
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.888
Go on, now.

585
01:10:08.957 --> 01:10:12.415
What the hell is this between you and him?

586
01:10:13.595 --> 01:10:15.859
What's that you call it?

587
01:10:18.033 --> 01:10:21.790
That might as well have been you
out there dismembering people.

588
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:24.160
He ain't hurting no one
that don't got it coming.

589
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.073
He took my fucking hand!

590
01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:32.068
We fall short of God's glory
because of people like you.

591
01:10:32.748 --> 01:10:36.805
What about Marla?
Because that's who he's off getting tonight.

592
01:10:36.885 --> 01:10:41.243
I seen the pictures, the spying
you've been doing for him!

593
01:10:41.323 --> 01:10:44.887
God, that's how he knows
where to find who he needs to find.

594
01:10:44.967 --> 01:10:49.018
If Marla dies tonight,
I'm gonna make sure that falls on you.

595
01:10:49.098 --> 01:10:51.042
His faith is being tested,

596
01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:53.109
- like I'm being tested.
- Where's he coming in from?

597
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:54.827
- It's the only way he knows.
- No, I need to know.

598
01:10:54.907 --> 01:10:57.929
- So we can be together.
- Where's he coming in from?

599
01:11:07.182 --> 01:11:09.772
You expect him to come get you?

600
01:11:09.852 --> 01:11:12.121
Come and save you?

601
01:11:13.021 --> 01:11:15.454
I'm the one saving him.

602
01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.572
Well, you ain't gonna do
too good of a job of that tonight.

603
01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:28.642
There's gonna be trouble like you've never
known if you don't let him finish that list.

604
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:37.516
What are you doing to her?

605
01:11:40.549 --> 01:11:43.139
There's only ever been three crosses.

606
01:11:43.619 --> 01:11:47.042
Someone's gonna come aiming to take Lilly
out of here. You don't try to be brave.

607
01:11:47.122 --> 01:11:50.947
You let him do just that. He's gonna ask,
and you tell him where Marla and Shep went.

608
01:11:51.027 --> 01:11:53.182
- I don't know where they went.
- The crosses down on Carrion Road.

609
01:11:53.262 --> 01:11:55.152
Tell him that,
and don't get in his way, you hear?

610
01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:58.395
- Where are you going?
- To protect this town.

611
01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:02.808
Dig faster, lollipop.
It'll help you stay warm.

612
01:12:07.643 --> 01:12:09.849
I found something.

613
01:12:13.549 --> 01:12:17.916
See? I told you little hands go faster.

614
01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.271
Come on.

615
01:12:42.177 --> 01:12:44.400
This is just a third.

616
01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.835
This is nothing but his cut.

617
01:12:46.915 --> 01:12:49.918
He left my money behind.
It ain't gonna be enough.

618
01:12:52.488 --> 01:12:54.710
Okay, there were other ones,

619
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.479
some other jobs he did for me.

620
01:12:57.559 --> 01:12:59.769
Where does he keep his money?

621
01:13:00.429 --> 01:13:03.018
We're both on the fucking list.

622
01:13:36.264 --> 01:13:38.003
Lilly?

623
01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:51.904
Sorry, cap, we're... we're closed.

624
01:13:51.984 --> 01:13:54.153
Where is she?

625
01:13:54.483 --> 01:13:57.942
Well, seems the poor girl
got herself into an accident.

626
01:14:01.557 --> 01:14:03.779
Don't surprise me none.

627
01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:06.088
I'm sorry?

628
01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:09.036
I said it don't surprise me.

629
01:14:10.966 --> 01:14:15.061
She's a... she talks like she's
the only one that's gonna be saved.

630
01:14:19.474 --> 01:14:21.163
Who's responsible?

631
01:14:21.243 --> 01:14:25.967
- Ain't nothing responsible for an accident.
- I said, who's responsible?

632
01:14:26.982 --> 01:14:30.737
You best remind Lilly,
there ain't no one walking this earth...

633
01:14:31.987 --> 01:14:33.742
who is saved.

634
01:14:33.822 --> 01:14:36.278
Then you tell me what you see.

635
01:14:47.536 --> 01:14:49.741
What do we do now?

636
01:15:06.021 --> 01:15:09.545
This was Ken's dream.
This is why he wanted the money.

637
01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.613
Jesus Christ.

638
01:15:11.693 --> 01:15:15.401
I really hate that I'm believing you,
just let me tell you that.

639
01:15:22.638 --> 01:15:26.661
He died for that patch of earth.
This just seems so fucking meaningless.

640
01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:29.631
Yeah, we'll all have
a good cry about that later.

641
01:15:29.711 --> 01:15:31.767
You see that?

642
01:15:31.847 --> 01:15:34.236
You see that? Come here.

643
01:15:34.316 --> 01:15:36.072
Look.

644
01:15:36.752 --> 01:15:38.373
Hear that?

645
01:15:38.653 --> 01:15:41.644
Who's that knocking at your door?

646
01:15:41.924 --> 01:15:43.411
- You hear that?
- Someday somebody is gonna

647
01:15:43.491 --> 01:15:47.147
put a bullet in that fucking
fat head of yours!

648
01:15:48.029 --> 01:15:52.554
You're just about 110 pounds
of bummer, ain't you? Come on.

649
01:15:52.634 --> 01:15:54.773
Give me that.

650
01:15:56.738 --> 01:15:58.995
Now, look, baby.

651
01:16:00.475 --> 01:16:02.798
This money is part yours too.

652
01:16:03.078 --> 01:16:05.501
Do you want it or not?

653
01:16:06.681 --> 01:16:10.307
Well, go find something
for us to break this ground.

654
01:16:12.087 --> 01:16:14.026
Go!

655
01:17:01.403 --> 01:17:03.875
Oh, goddamn it.

656
01:17:09.578 --> 01:17:11.186
Oh, Harry.

657
01:17:13.048 --> 01:17:15.193
Where is he?

658
01:17:16.652 --> 01:17:18.440
He got away!

659
01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.298
Leland? Oh, God!

660
01:17:22.224 --> 01:17:25.564
Jerry? Jerry, where are you?

661
01:18:12.607 --> 01:18:14.446
Come on!

662
01:18:21.516 --> 01:18:23.839
- You're not afraid of dying, are you?
- No!

663
01:18:23.919 --> 01:18:26.142
I'll get you there!

664
01:18:27.122 --> 01:18:29.294
Take me to Lilly!

665
01:18:43.839 --> 01:18:47.879
Hurry up! We don't have all night!

666
01:19:05.927 --> 01:19:08.251
<i>Wallace, are you there?</i>

667
01:19:09.781 --> 01:19:12.521
<i>Wallace? Wallace!</i>

668
01:19:17.739 --> 01:19:20.546
- <i>Wallace, are you there?</i>
- Marla...

669
01:19:26.548 --> 01:19:28.937
Wallace, come get me.

670
01:19:29.517 --> 01:19:31.589
<i>I can't.</i>

671
01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:37.954
I saw your name on that list.

672
01:19:39.611 --> 01:19:41.948
He's coming through here to get to you.

673
01:19:43.298 --> 01:19:47.022
<i>I'm gonna slow him down a bit
so you can disappear.</i>

674
01:19:47.102 --> 01:19:50.426
Wallace, don't... don't...

675
01:19:51.006 --> 01:19:53.128
<i>I always told you...</i>

676
01:19:53.208 --> 01:19:55.969
<i>that you deserve better, Marla.</i>

677
01:19:57.379 --> 01:19:59.852
But I never said I didn't love you.

678
01:20:07.656 --> 01:20:09.494
Wallace?

679
01:20:16.765 --> 01:20:19.207
Hey! What the hell you doing?

680
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.763
<i>Guthrie...</i>

681
01:20:28.473 --> 01:20:32.450
that was his name, Harland Guthrie.

682
01:20:34.249 --> 01:20:36.821
First man I killed.

683
01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.476
Now I'm old and numb,
but that stinger's still in there,

684
01:20:41.556 --> 01:20:45.447
the kind of sorry that burns in you...

685
01:20:46.227 --> 01:20:50.152
for cutting the breath of one
of God's own creatures like that.

686
01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:54.723
Seeing you with her...

687
01:20:55.103 --> 01:20:57.827
like Harland looked at his wife...

688
01:20:59.107 --> 01:21:01.765
just days before he killed her.

689
01:21:03.445 --> 01:21:05.266
I've been wondering a lot about you.

690
01:21:05.346 --> 01:21:08.535
I've been thinking that,
you know, if you...

691
01:21:09.584 --> 01:21:13.309
if you fail them...

692
01:21:14.489 --> 01:21:16.844
if Shep goes on living like he does,

693
01:21:16.924 --> 01:21:20.163
then they won't hesitate to punish you.

694
01:21:21.429 --> 01:21:24.487
And they'll do to you
what you've been trying to do to him.

695
01:21:25.567 --> 01:21:27.989
They will erase you.

696
01:21:28.369 --> 01:21:32.023
And they'll erase all memory of you,
starting with her.

697
01:21:32.473 --> 01:21:35.196
With God by our side,
who can be against us?

698
01:21:35.276 --> 01:21:37.765
Come the morning hour...

699
01:21:37.845 --> 01:21:42.237
you'll reckon it's better
she dies by your hand

700
01:21:42.317 --> 01:21:44.672
than their cruel hooks.

701
01:21:44.752 --> 01:21:48.208
And then you'll be just like old Harland.

702
01:21:52.594 --> 01:21:56.223
I'll make the same deal tomorrow,
one just like it.

703
01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:59.388
Why don't you just leave with her?

704
01:22:15.984 --> 01:22:19.741
- You ain't gonna make it.
- Neither are you.

705
01:22:19.821 --> 01:22:23.210
Time to add a few more crosses
to Carrion Road.

706
01:22:40.275 --> 01:22:43.833
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

707
01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.768
All right.

708
01:22:46.848 --> 01:22:49.454
I think we're a minute into your time.

709
01:22:53.488 --> 01:22:56.011
You gonna try something stupid again?

710
01:22:56.291 --> 01:22:58.013
No.

711
01:22:58.193 --> 01:23:01.427
Oh, yeah, it's a fucking
smelly zoo, isn't it?

712
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:05.388
Don't worry, baby.
We're gonna get you stinking too.

713
01:23:06.468 --> 01:23:08.190
Come here.

714
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:11.893
All right. Two hands.

715
01:23:11.973 --> 01:23:15.597
Okay, come on. Grab it, two hands.

716
01:23:15.677 --> 01:23:19.301
Okay. Now, what you want to do is,
you want to lift up.

717
01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:23.538
You want to put your shoulders into it,
and you bring it down.

718
01:23:23.618 --> 01:23:29.211
Real good. Come on, baby. Let's go.
You want your money, you got to earn it.

719
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:32.893
Yeah, well, you can fucking keep it!

720
01:23:33.495 --> 01:23:35.300
God!

721
01:23:36.197 --> 01:23:37.971
God!

722
01:23:38.984 --> 01:23:41.741
Come back, you bitch!

723
01:24:17.138 --> 01:24:19.761
You're gonna finish off the list for me.

724
01:24:20.141 --> 01:24:24.349
First you're gonna cross out the girl,
then the salesman.

725
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.659
If you know the girl don't belong,
why not let her go?

726
01:24:34.689 --> 01:24:39.347
Because it's not the true shape
of fidelity. Shit!

727
01:25:37.719 --> 01:25:39.958
I see you.

728
01:25:46.461 --> 01:25:48.666
Say it again.

729
01:25:52.634 --> 01:25:54.076
Wallace...

730
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.498
Only killing I'll ever see again...

731
01:26:03.978 --> 01:26:06.217
is you killing me.

732
01:26:09.784 --> 01:26:12.190
And I don't even know your name.

733
01:26:15.523 --> 01:26:17.362
Wallace?

734
01:26:21.279 --> 01:26:24.102
You put this on yourself, son.

735
01:26:24.932 --> 01:26:27.766
You don't get to walk away
from this place.

736
01:26:29.704 --> 01:26:32.061
Don't got to be this way.

737
01:26:33.241 --> 01:26:36.331
Don't let it take you, huh?

738
01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:38.233
Wallace?

739
01:26:38.613 --> 01:26:41.338
Give me... give me the gun.

740
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:46.374
Don't go down the path I did, Wallace.

741
01:26:46.604 --> 01:26:48.309
Huh?

742
01:26:50.091 --> 01:26:52.297
I see you.

743
01:26:54.562 --> 01:26:56.771
Good enough.

744
01:27:41.042 --> 01:27:43.563
It's gonna be all right.

745
01:27:44.946 --> 01:27:47.218
It'll be just fine.

746
01:27:49.484 --> 01:27:51.689
Now get out of here.

747
01:30:18.999 --> 01:30:22.389
I couldn't keep waiting for you, so...

748
01:30:24.105 --> 01:30:26.394
I like that you're here.

749
01:30:26.574 --> 01:30:31.147
After some thinking,
I decided I'd come and get you.

750
01:30:32.847 --> 01:30:35.620
You know, keep driving.

751
01:30:40.888 --> 01:30:43.978
- I like that.
- Get in the car.

752

How'd you find me?

768
01:32:24.692 --> 01:32:26.481
Patience.

769

And I'm telling you, boy,
when I get serious, I stay fucking serious.

Come on.

772
01:32:40.307 --> 01:32:45.249
I keep hearing these stories
about good people disappearing.

773
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:50.905
If you're talking
about that offer I made...

774
01:32:51.485 --> 01:32:53.307
that still stands.

775
01:32:53.387 --> 01:32:55.109
Is that right?

776
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:58.226
All you got to do
is let me walk out that door.

777
01:32:59.577 --> 01:33:01.778
Let me disappear.

778
01:33:02.597 --> 01:33:05.554
No such thing as disappearing, Shep.

779
01:33:06.734 --> 01:33:09.020
There's only dying.

780
01:33:10.337 --> 01:33:13.795
As far as good people go...
