3
00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:39.492
Chow time!

4
00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:40.788
It's time!

5
00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:44.251
Floyd, step up to the door.
Dinner time.

6
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:49.414
Only my friends call me Floyd.

7
00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.806
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

8
00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.603
What's that?

9
00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:56.197
That is called loaf.

10
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.164
A loaf.

11
00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.444
It's got a little bit of pasghetti in there.

12
00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.043
Toenails.

13
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.440
Rat shit.

14
00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:05.177
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.

15
00:01:06.158 --> 00:01:08.384
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?

16
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.382
Yeah.

17
00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:11.057
One day...

18
00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:13.881
somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

19
00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:18.672
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the Holy Ghost.

20
00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:22.606
Man, you just threatened a staff member.

21
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:23.524
Yeah?

22
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.681
Yeah, you have.

23
00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:26.161
Do something.

24
00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.783
Let's have some fun.

25
00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:29.629
Whoop his ass!

26
00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.362
Open the goddamn gate!

27
00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:00.947
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

28
00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:05.158
Sector C! Pull your heads out of your ass!
The boss is on deck!

29
00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:08.379
Open it!

30
00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:09.858
Bravo 14 open perimeter fence.

31
00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:11.162
Stay back.

32
00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:13.631
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

33
00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:17.509
You gonna come down from there or what?

34
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.028
Yeah.
Look at you.

35
00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.937
You know the rules, hotness.

36
00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:27.344
You gotta keep off these bars.

37
00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:30.371
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

38
00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:32.859
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:37.196
You are really in bad shape upstairs, lady!

40
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:39.514
Gonna come in here
and tell me that?

41
00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.487
Or are you too scared?

42
00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:43.269
Come on, I'm bored.

43
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.712
I'm bored.
Play with me.

44
00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:47.261
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.

45
00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:49.675
No one's gonna play with you.

46
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.306
You sleep on the ground.

47
00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:56.112
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.

48
00:02:57.207 --> 00:02:58.903
Oh, man.
I love you.

49
00:02:58.928 --> 00:02:59.950
Alpha One.

50
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.242
<i>Hit her.</i>

51
00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:06.426
Come on, man. You're six foot four.
She's a tiny little girl.

52
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:08.934
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

53
00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.837
We got chocolates, strawberry or vanilla.

54
00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:15.894
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

55
00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:18.687
Spring Break!

56
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:27.465
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.

57
00:03:47.544 --> 00:03:51.343
<i>The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.</i>

58
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.837
<B> And then it changed again
when he didn't. </ b>.

59
00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:57.512
Remember.

60
00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.472
<i>And that is why I'm here.</i>

61
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.127
SUICIDE
SQUAD

62
00:04:26.722 --> 00:04:28.670
Hello, Amanda.

63
00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:30.401
We lose a national hero...

64
00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:32.990
but you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.

65
00:04:33.015 --> 00:04:35.338
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

66
00:04:35.363 --> 00:04:37.288
It's taken some work.

67
00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:41.335
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

68
00:04:42.257 --> 00:04:44.954
There's rumors, Amanda that...

69
00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:47.137
some of them have abilities.

70
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.145
The rumors are right.

71
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.809
You know what the problem
with a metahuman is?

72
00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.472
The human part.

73
00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:54.781
We got lucky with Superman.

74
00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:56.601
He shared our values.

75
00:04:56.602 --> 00:04:58.255
The next Superman might not.

76
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.681
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

77
00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:01.884
I'm fighting fire with fire.

78
00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:06.279
You are not going to pitch us that
Task Force X project of yours again, are you?

79
00:05:06.304 --> 00:05:07.759
Yes

80
00:05:07.784 --> 00:05:10.074
But this time, you're gonna listen.

81
00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:14.743
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.

82
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:19.185
<font color="#fd5583">DEADSHOT</font>

83
00:05:21.107 --> 00:05:23.402
FAMILY: DAUGHTER , EX-WIFE

84
00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:33.276
He's the most wanted hitman
in the world.

85
00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:40.477
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

86
00:05:40.894 --> 00:05:41.905
What?

87
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.409
Hey, Angelo.

88
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.851
This is the exterminator you called
for your rat problem.

89
00:05:46.876 --> 00:05:49.369
My account's looking a little thin.

90
00:05:49.394 --> 00:05:52.367
No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.

91
00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:55.577
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.

92
00:05:56.343 --> 00:05:58.785
Whoa, here is your boy right now.

93
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.617
With about 20 of his
new best friends.

94
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.401
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

95
00:06:08.426 --> 00:06:10.905
Listen.
Stop being cute and do your job!

96
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.609
Oh.
They're taking him outta the car now.

97
00:06:13.634 --> 00:06:16.912
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

98
00:06:16.937 --> 00:06:19.095
Okayay, okay, okay.
Relax.

99
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.733
There was an accounting error.

100
00:06:20.758 --> 00:06:22.387
We sent it.

101
00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:24.244
Now double it for being a dickhead.

102
00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:25.560
You got 10 seconds.

103
00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.525
We're not the kind of people
you play with.

104
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.397
Did you just...
Did you threaten me?

105
00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:32.281
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

106
00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:34.868
You son of a bitch.

107
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.371
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

108
00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.709
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

109
00:06:59.734 --> 00:07:03.124
His is an 11-year-old
honor student in Gotham city.

110
00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:04.317
His daughter.

111
00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:06.798
So we watched her and waited.

112
00:07:06.823 --> 00:07:09.164
You should talk to Mama more.

113
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.828
Yeah, yeah, I know

114
00:07:10.853 --> 00:07:12.697
Mama stays in bed a lot.

115
00:07:12.722 --> 00:07:14.919
Yeah.
She's still going out at night?

116
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.800
Dad, it's okay.

117
00:07:16.825 --> 00:07:18.918
I can take care of her.

118
00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:21.232
I know how to make pancakes now.

119
00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:23.418
Hey babe, that's beautiful.

120
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.839
She's supposed to be taking
care of you, you know.

121
00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:27.740
That's how that's
supposed to work.

122
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.748
I want you to come live with me.

123
00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:35.817
All right? I came into some resources.
I'm gonna get us spot.

124
00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:38.148
It's gonna be nice, all right?

125
00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:41.632
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.

126
00:07:41.657 --> 00:07:44.881
That's not true. That's a lie.
She's lying to you.

127
00:07:44.906 --> 00:07:46.160
Daddy...

128
00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:48.756
I know you do bad things.

129
00:07:48.781 --> 00:07:51.998
Don't worry.
I still love you.

130
00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.679
Come on.

131
00:07:56.574 --> 00:07:57.751
And you caught him?

132
00:07:57.752 --> 00:07:58.877
Not me.

133
00:07:58.902 --> 00:08:02.312
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham City.

134
00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:04.232
I'mma figure this out.

135
00:08:04.257 --> 00:08:05.900
All right?

136
00:08:09.863 --> 00:08:12.047
It's over, Deadshot.

137
00:08:12.072 --> 00:08:14.662
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.

138
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.533
Daddy, please.

139
00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:26.285
Zoe, move!

140
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.994
Please Daddy.
Don't do it.

141
00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:32.514
Please.

142
00:08:33.568 --> 00:08:35.496
Don't do it.

143
00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:47.698
All right.

144
00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:56.593
I love you, daddy.

145
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.770
So now we have the man
who never misses.

146
00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:00.997
Where'd you put him?

147
00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:04.486
Let's just say. I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.

148
00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:07.743
Harley Quinn.

149
00:09:11.312 --> 00:09:14.135
accomplice to the murder of <font color="#80ff00">ROBIN</font>

150
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.218
ARKHAM

151
00:09:15.243 --> 00:09:17.395
Before she ran off
and joined the circus...

152
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.995
She was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

153
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.007
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.

154
00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:26.255
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

155
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.259
Dr. Quinzel.

156
00:09:29.284 --> 00:09:32.248
You know,
I live for these moments with you.

157
00:09:32.273 --> 00:09:33.464
What do you got?

158
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.754
I got you a kitty.

159
00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:37.024
So thoughtful.

160
00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:38.658
She thought she was curing him...

161
00:09:38.683 --> 00:09:41.340
but she was falling in love.

162
00:09:42.437 --> 00:09:45.276
There is something you
could do for me, Doctor

163
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:47.293
Anything.
I mean, yeah.

164
00:09:47.318 --> 00:09:49.748
I need a machine gun.

165
00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:53.854
A Machine gun?

166
00:09:55.156 --> 00:09:58.173
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

167
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.019
Get off me!
Get...!

168
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.786
What do we have here?

169
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.516
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

170
00:10:21.517 --> 00:10:22.932
What?

171
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.464
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

172
00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:30.097
I'm just gonna hurt ya...

173
00:10:30.122 --> 00:10:34.384
really, really bad.

174
00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:35.968
You think so?

175
00:10:35.993 --> 00:10:37.988
Well, I can take it.

176
00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:42.612
La la.
La la la.

177
00:10:45.738 --> 00:10:49.105
They became the king and
queen of Gotham city.

178
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.431
And God help anyone
who disrespected the queen.

179
00:10:52.654 --> 00:10:53.844
We finally meet.

180
00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:55.729
He don't shake hands.

181
00:10:55.754 --> 00:10:59.193
But sit down and have a drink.

182
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.255
Hey, J.

183
00:11:03.256 --> 00:11:06.546
On behalf of everybody,
welcome back.

184
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:09.415
I wanted to come by and
personally say thank you.

185
00:11:09.416 --> 00:11:12.386
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

186
00:11:12.411 --> 00:11:14.672
Are you sweet talking me?

187
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.624
Ha. Ha. Ha.

188
00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:19.896
I love this guy.

189
00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:23.300
He's so intense!

190
00:11:27.778 --> 00:11:30.085
You're lucky man.

191
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.398
You got a bad bitch.

192
00:11:34.556 --> 00:11:36.772
Oh, that she is.

193
00:11:37.508 --> 00:11:40.936
The fire in my loins.

194
00:11:40.961 --> 00:11:43.296
The itch in my crotch.

195
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:49.310
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

196
00:11:58.147 --> 00:12:01.311
Oh, come to Daddy.

197
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.890
- Puddin'!
- Oh yeah.

198
00:12:03.915 --> 00:12:04.821
Listen..

199
00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:09.906
you are my gift to this
handsome hunka hunka!

200
00:12:09.931 --> 00:12:12.502
You belong to him now.

201
00:12:12.527 --> 00:12:13.892
Well.

202
00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:18.916
You're cute!

203
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.067
You want me?

204
00:12:21.346 --> 00:12:23.944
I'm all yours.

205
00:12:26.308 --> 00:12:27.689
I don't want no beef.

206
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.982
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

207
00:12:30.007 --> 00:12:32.629
- Why, what's wrong? You don't like me?
- You don't want no beef?

208
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.130
Fine.
Don't waste my time then.

209
00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:35.723
This is your lady.

210
00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:36.788
Look...

211
00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:39.761
are you enjoying yourself?

212
00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:42.163
No.

213
00:12:42.188 --> 00:12:43.585
That's your lady, Joker.

214
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.821
- That's right.
- Yeah.

215
00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:46.310
Yo, J.

216
00:12:49.672 --> 00:12:52.021
And that was just the beginning.

217
00:12:59.762 --> 00:13:02.745
Come on, Puddin'.
Do it!

218
00:13:03.256 --> 00:13:04.552
Oh...

219
00:13:04.577 --> 00:13:06.507
We have got company.

220
00:13:06.532 --> 00:13:09.706
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

221
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.308
She's crazier than him.

222
00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:15.507
And more fearless.

223
00:13:15.532 --> 00:13:19.006
Stupid Bat, you're ruining date night!

224
00:13:21.014 --> 00:13:22.671
Puddin'.

225
00:13:24.745 --> 00:13:27.544
Puddin', I can't swim!

226
00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:05.823
But the Bat got her, too.

227
00:14:05.848 --> 00:14:08.637
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.

228
00:14:22.622 --> 00:14:24.650
And then there's the Aussie.

229
00:14:24.675 --> 00:14:26.175
Digger Harkness.

230
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.107
Or as the tabloids call him.
Capitan Boomerang.

231
00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:33.962
<font color="#ffff80">Captain Boomerang</font>
Fetishes:<font color="#ff80c0"> Pink Unicorns</font>

232
00:14:37.573 --> 00:14:40.281
We're gonna be rich.

233
00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:42.100
Yeah, you and me, mate.

234
00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:43.226
Go and get the car.

235
00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:46.190
He robbed every bank in Australia
at least once.

236
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.742
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.

237
00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:53.460
Doesn't work well with others.

238
00:14:58.302 --> 00:15:00.619
No honor among thieves, eh?

239
00:15:01.746 --> 00:15:05.612
But he tangled with a metahuman
and lived to tell about it.

240
00:15:05.637 --> 00:15:08.904
And have you heard of
the pyro kinetic homeboy?

241
00:15:12.717 --> 00:15:14.251
How'd you catch him?

242
00:15:14.276 --> 00:15:17.091
We didn't.
He surrendered.

243
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.409
Chato Santana.

244
00:15:19.434 --> 00:15:21.934
On the streets they call him El Diablo.

245
00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:24.882
This LA gangbanger thought
he was the king of the world...

246
00:15:24.907 --> 00:15:27.433
until he lost his queen.

247
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:33.024
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

248
00:15:33.049 --> 00:15:35.961
The security video is incredible.

249
00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:40.891
Oh, Jesus.

250
00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:43.603
- What the hell is that?
- His name is Waylon Jones.

251
00:15:43.628 --> 00:15:46.545
K.C!
Dinner.

252
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.742
Open it up, B.

253
00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:50.914
Evolution took a step backwards
with this one.

254
00:15:51.635 --> 00:15:53.320
Give me that, Smitty.

255
00:15:54.331 --> 00:15:56.007
Where you at?

256
00:15:56.859 --> 00:15:59.354
They call him Killer Croc.

257
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.427
He looked like a monster.

258
00:16:03.452 --> 00:16:05.990
So they treated him
like a monster.

259
00:16:06.315 --> 00:16:09.120
Then he became a monster.

260
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.343
He was chased out of Gotham by the bat.

261
00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:16.106
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

262
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:18.075
He never found it.

263
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.801
I saved the best for last.

264
00:16:28.213 --> 00:16:29.194
The witch.

265
00:16:29.219 --> 00:16:30.098
A witch?

266
00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:33.733
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

267
00:16:33.758 --> 00:16:37.309
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

268
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.685
Archaeologist Dr. June Moone...

269
00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:45.417
wondered into the wrong cave.

270
00:16:52.364 --> 00:16:55.022
June...

271
00:16:58.427 --> 00:17:01.140
She opened something she shouldn't have...

272
00:17:11.513 --> 00:17:16.110
... releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

273
00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:18.450
The Enchantress.

274
00:17:18.475 --> 00:17:22.725
ENCHANTRESS
AKA
DR JUNE MOONE

275
00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:26.122
She inhabits Dr.Moone's body now.

276
00:17:26.147 --> 00:17:27.828
Where is this witch?

277
00:17:27.853 --> 00:17:29.649
In my pocket.

278
00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:32.051
Now tell him why she won't
turn you into a frog.

279
00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:34.865
Some say the witch has
a secret buried heart...

280
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.458
and whoever finds it
can control the witch.

281
00:17:37.483 --> 00:17:39.538
So we searched the cave
where she turned up...

282
00:17:39.563 --> 00:17:41.993
and we found her heart.

283
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:46.775
- That thing's her heart?
- Mmm.

284
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.484
She's vulnerable without it.

285
00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:51.034
You want to put our
national security in the hands of...

286
00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:54.345
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

287
00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:55.879
Don't forget about
The Joker's girlfriend.

288
00:17:55.904 --> 00:17:57.387
These are villains, Amanda.

289
00:17:57.414 --> 00:17:59.482
What makes you think
you can control them?

290
00:17:59.507 --> 00:18:02.359
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interests...

291
00:18:02.384 --> 00:18:06.707
for the national security of
the United States is what I do for a living.

292
00:18:06.732 --> 00:18:10.631
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced...

293
00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.545
Colonel Rick Flag.

294
00:18:15.842 --> 00:18:21.235
COLONEL
RICK FLAG

295
00:18:35.216 --> 00:18:36.965
Help me.

296
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.317
I assigned him to watch Dr.Moone,
and just as I hoped...

297
00:18:40.342 --> 00:18:42.297
it got personal.

298
00:18:42.298 --> 00:18:44.117
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

299
00:18:44.142 --> 00:18:45.761
I have the witch's heart.

300
00:18:45.786 --> 00:18:48.404
And Dr.Moone has his.

301
00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:52.518
Now he'll follow my orders
as Holy Writ.

302
00:18:54.959 --> 00:18:57.170
In a world of flying men and monsters...

303
00:18:57.195 --> 00:19:00.423
this is the only way
to protect our country.

304
00:19:01.122 --> 00:19:03.709
THE PENTAGON
WASHINGTON DC

305
00:19:03.734 --> 00:19:09.524
What if Superman had decided to fly down,
rip off the roof of the White House...

306
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:13.428
and grab the President of the United States
right out of the Overall office?

307
00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:15.530
Who would've stopped him?

308
00:19:16.013 --> 00:19:19.101
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea...

309
00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:21.824
anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.

310
00:19:21.849 --> 00:19:24.881
But what happens if the next Superman...

311
00:19:24.882 --> 00:19:27.148
becomes a terrorist?

312
00:19:27.283 --> 00:19:29.864
Amanda Waller has a plan.
Amanda.

313
00:19:29.889 --> 00:19:33.839
I wanna build a team of some very bad people
who I think can do some good.

314
00:19:33.864 --> 00:19:36.587
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

315
00:19:36.612 --> 00:19:38.094
Not on my watch.

316
00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:41.675
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

317
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.978
General, we run them covertly non-attributed.
Strictly need to know.

318
00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:48.723
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.

319
00:19:48.748 --> 00:19:51.013
The next war will be fought
with these metahumans.

320
00:19:51.038 --> 00:19:53.284
Ours, or theirs.

321
00:19:53.309 --> 00:19:55.700
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

322
00:19:55.725 --> 00:19:58.777
You know we can't control these people.

323
00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:05.525
June, be strong.

324
00:20:06.354 --> 00:20:08.052
Dr.Moone.

325
00:20:32.884 --> 00:20:35.128
Enchantress

326
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.164
Meet the Enchantress.

327
00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:54.160
Everything we know about her,
is in your briefing packs.

328
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:56.680
She's walked this earth
for a very long time

329
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:59.377
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

330
00:20:59.378 --> 00:21:02.136
This meeting is-
is now a magic show?

331
00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:05.881
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

332
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.919
Go get it, girl.

333
00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:29.779
How about a little something from
the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

334
00:21:38.349 --> 00:21:41.290
We've been chasing these plans for years.

335
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:45.990
Please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

336
00:21:46.015 --> 00:21:48.638
Thank you.
We'd like Dr.Moone back.

337
00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:59.348
Enchantress.

338
00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:02.065
Please.
Please.

339
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.621
I'm sorry.
I can't-I can't do that again.

340
00:22:04.646 --> 00:22:06.909
Flag, get her out of here.

341
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.615
I move to...

342
00:22:10.616 --> 00:22:15.798
authorize Amanda Waller to establish
Task Force X under the ARGUS program.

343
00:22:17.697 --> 00:22:19.291
All right.

344
00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:22.176
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

345
00:22:33.246 --> 00:22:35.234
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

346
00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:36.429
How you doing, man?

347
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.533
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.

348
00:22:38.558 --> 00:22:40.733
Welcome, ma'am.
How are you?

349
00:22:40.758 --> 00:22:43.099
I'm here to assist you in anyway.

350
00:22:43.124 --> 00:22:44.880
Where are they?

351
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.539
Are you the Devil?

352
00:23:06.349 --> 00:23:08.375
Maybe.

353
00:23:37.508 --> 00:23:40.129
Ain't you scared?

354
00:23:44.577 --> 00:23:47.475
Why'd they put you down here?

355
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.172
I asked.

356
00:23:54.775 --> 00:23:56.341
Yo, ese

357
00:23:56.342 --> 00:23:58.603
Hola, amigo.

358
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:02.112
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

359
00:24:12.607 --> 00:24:15.747
What's up?
Hey, you want some of this?

360
00:24:15.772 --> 00:24:17.763
Come down here.

361
00:24:17.788 --> 00:24:19.536
That ain't me.

362
00:24:19.537 --> 00:24:20.669
That wasn't you?

363
00:24:20.694 --> 00:24:22.548
Nah, they say it's me,
but that ain't me.

364
00:24:22.573 --> 00:24:24.030
That guy's gone.

365
00:24:24.031 --> 00:24:25.265
He's dead.

366
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.600
And yet, here you are.

367
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:27.402
Ma'am.

368
00:24:27.427 --> 00:24:29.531
Let me try to talk to him.

369
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.863
You wanna die in here, buddy?

370
00:24:35.888 --> 00:24:38.686
You got a real shot at
walking at the block again.

371
00:24:38.711 --> 00:24:42.020
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

372
00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:43.097
A Women.

373
00:24:43.122 --> 00:24:44.199
Look, man ...

374
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.358
You ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

375
00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:48.682
Ask what?

376
00:24:48.707 --> 00:24:50.733
I'm a man, okay?

377
00:24:50.758 --> 00:24:52.646
I ain't no weapon.

378
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.316
I'mmna die in peace before
I raise my fists again.

379
00:24:56.903 --> 00:24:59.506
I've caused enough harm.

380
00:25:01.757 --> 00:25:03.426
BYE

381
00:25:08.277 --> 00:25:09.739
All right, unlock him.

382
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.760
What?

383
00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:11.843
You heard me.

384
00:25:11.868 --> 00:25:13.155
You know what this man can do?

385
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.085
I'm here to find out.
Lose the restraints.

386
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.914
Thank you.

387
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.623
What?
This uh...

388
00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:27.419
cheerleading tryouts?

389
00:25:27.444 --> 00:25:29.279
Let's go.
Let's see what you can do.

390
00:25:29.304 --> 00:25:31.135
They say you never missed a shot.

391
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.990
Prove it.

392
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:47.261
Now you got one in the chamber.

393
00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:49.001
What cha' gonna do with it?

394
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:50.537
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey!

395
00:25:50.562 --> 00:25:51.706
- Shit!
- Drop it.

396
00:25:51.731 --> 00:25:53.089
Give me the word, boss.
I'll drop him.

397
00:25:53.114 --> 00:25:54.831
Everybody calm down.

398
00:25:54.856 --> 00:25:56.394
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

399
00:25:56.419 --> 00:25:57.814
Tell them to put it down.

400
00:25:57.839 --> 00:25:58.994
Stand down!

401
00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:01.844
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about!

402
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:02.769
What's for dinner?

403
00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:04.766
Ames, if this man shoots me ...

404
00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:06.538
I want you to kill him ...

405
00:26:07.293 --> 00:26:09.942
and I want you to go
clear my browser history.

406
00:26:10.459 --> 00:26:12.112
See ...

407
00:26:12.329 --> 00:26:14.477
the firing pin is filed down, right?

408
00:26:14.502 --> 00:26:15.886
Mag full of dummy rounds.

409
00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:18.043
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

410
00:26:18.068 --> 00:26:19.788
You're absolutely right.

411
00:26:19.813 --> 00:26:22.710
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

412
00:26:22.711 --> 00:26:25.222
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
Empty it.

413
00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:27.584
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

414
00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:29.511
I've known you, like, nine months.

415
00:26:29.536 --> 00:26:32.425
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.

416
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.430
Aw, shit.

417
00:26:34.975 --> 00:26:36.027
What?

418
00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:37.504
Shit.

419
00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.843
Oops

420
00:26:38.868 --> 00:26:40.211
Oh...

421
00:26:40.726 --> 00:26:43.334
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

422
00:27:32.258 --> 00:27:34.581
All right.
Now you know what you're buying.

423
00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:36.418
Let me tell you the price.
First...

424
00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:38.050
I want outta here.

425
00:27:38.051 --> 00:27:41.274
Second, I want full custody of my daughter.

426
00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:41.995
All right?

427
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.392
And her mom can have like...
supervised visits.

428
00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:46.280
But her stank ass boyfriend can't come.

429
00:27:46.305 --> 00:27:47.731
Darnell can't come.

430
00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.609
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

431
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.464
Third, y'all gonna pay for
my daughter's whole education.

432
00:27:52.465 --> 00:27:53.698
Best schools.

433
00:27:53.723 --> 00:27:55.299
And then I want her
to go to college

434
00:27:55.324 --> 00:27:57.215
like Harvard or Yale.

435
00:27:57.216 --> 00:27:58.939
- Ivy league.
- Ivy league, yeah.

436
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.620
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mm-hm.

437
00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:03.656
And if she can't cut it,
and her grades start slipping,

438
00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:05.567
I need you to white-people that thing.
- Mm-hm.

439
00:28:05.592 --> 00:28:07.121
- You know how y'all do.
- Oh yeah.

440
00:28:07.146 --> 00:28:08.134
You know, right?
Okay.

441
00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:09.484
Now that's my price.

442
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:13.249
But I'm concerned, 'cause I don't
see nobody writing shit down.

443
00:28:13.274 --> 00:28:15.634
You're in no position
to make any demands.

444
00:28:15.635 --> 00:28:17.214
Oh.
I'm sorry.

445
00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:19.139
You thought I was talking to you.

446
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.313
No, errand boy.

447
00:28:20.338 --> 00:28:22.947
I'm talking to your boss.

448
00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:26.089
That's my price, sweetie.

449
00:28:26.114 --> 00:28:27.999
You know what it is.

450
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.004
You notice these are criminals?
Mm.

451
00:28:34.035 --> 00:28:37.490
They're psychotic antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

452
00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:39.422
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you

453
00:28:39.447 --> 00:28:41.238
a team of pipe hitters who'll do
anything you can dream up.

454
00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:43.584
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

455
00:28:43.585 --> 00:28:46.264
In World War 2, the US Navy
made a deal with the mafia

456
00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:48.228
to protect it's ships
on the waterfront.

457
00:28:48.253 --> 00:28:49.542
This ain't World War 2.

458
00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:51.727
It's World War 3.

459
00:28:51.819 --> 00:28:53.478
What are you really up to?

460
00:28:53.479 --> 00:28:56.224
It's a "need to know", and, all you
need to know is you work for me.

461
00:28:56.249 --> 00:28:57.999
That can change with a phone call.

462
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.051
I have friends too, you know.

463
00:29:01.693 --> 00:29:04.058
There you go.
Call'em.

464
00:29:04.106 --> 00:29:06.254
But without you minding her,
your lady friend stays here

465
00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:09.580
strapped to a board
in a drug-induced coma.

466
00:29:10.759 --> 00:29:13.077
They warned me about you.

467
00:29:13.978 --> 00:29:16.901
My dumbass didn't believe the stories.

468
00:29:21.785 --> 00:29:24.212
Nobody does.

469
00:29:33.215 --> 00:29:34.722
Where is she?

470
00:29:34.723 --> 00:29:38.091
It's complex.
This is not just her.

471
00:29:38.116 --> 00:29:40.020
Everybody's disappeared.

472
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:42.188
There's this new law,
where if you're a bad enough bad guy

473
00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:44.104
they stamp "Terrorist" on your jacket.

474
00:29:44.129 --> 00:29:47.243
They send you to
this swamp in Louisiana.

475
00:29:47.268 --> 00:29:48.890
A black site.

476
00:29:48.915 --> 00:29:50.793
That's where she is.

477
00:29:51.988 --> 00:29:53.766
So what do we do?

478
00:29:54.535 --> 00:29:56.521
Bring the car around.

479
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.552
We're going for a drive.

480
00:30:18.877 --> 00:30:21.828
Lester. Lester.
Hit me one more time!

481
00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:23.568
And...
Come on, man!

482
00:30:23.593 --> 00:30:26.596
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10k.

483
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:28.012
- You got it?
- Hey.

484
00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:31.153
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

485
00:30:35.745 --> 00:30:37.003
Good job, man.

486
00:30:37.028 --> 00:30:38.076
He's killing it.

487
00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:39.273
Come on, man.
Why am I here?

488
00:30:39.298 --> 00:30:41.449
All right! Yeah! I'm down.
I get it, all right?

489
00:30:41.474 --> 00:30:43.021
I've had a run of bad decks.

490
00:30:43.046 --> 00:30:44.709
Not my fault.

491
00:30:44.752 --> 00:30:45.861
All right?

492
00:30:45.862 --> 00:30:47.722
Dude, this is real.

493
00:30:47.723 --> 00:30:49.555
I had to stop these guys
from burning down your house

494
00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.311
with your kids in it.

495
00:30:55.703 --> 00:30:57.559
But, you're lucky.

496
00:30:57.584 --> 00:31:00.047
Yeah, maybe.
Why-Why do you think so?

497
00:31:03.423 --> 00:31:05.908
Yo, Slick.
What's up?

498
00:31:06.458 --> 00:31:08.614
Griggs.
You are?

499
00:31:08.639 --> 00:31:10.926
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

500
00:31:10.927 --> 00:31:13.171
Can I go, man?
What the hell's going on, man?

501
00:31:13.196 --> 00:31:14.637
This is crazy.

502
00:31:14.662 --> 00:31:19.968
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah,
blah-blah, blah-blah.

503
00:31:19.993 --> 00:31:23.015
All of that chitchat
is gonna get you hurt.

504
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.660
Oh!
My god.

505
00:31:44.592 --> 00:31:46.531
I could tell you meant that.

506
00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:48.239
Yeah.

507
00:31:50.814 --> 00:31:53.224
You're gonna be my friend.

508
00:32:09.408 --> 00:32:12.258
Enchantress.

509
00:32:23.114 --> 00:32:24.955
Log time of death, 16:20

510
00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.318
June?

511
00:32:27.956 --> 00:32:30.508
- Let's get her down to the morgue.
- June?

512
00:32:30.533 --> 00:32:32.182
June?

513
00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:34.162
June.

514
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.819
June.

515
00:32:38.913 --> 00:32:40.655
What did you do?

516
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.081
Shhh.

517
00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:44.590
Okay.

518
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.076
Sister.

519
00:33:15.878 --> 00:33:17.553
Brother.

520
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.425
Plus, it could be the routing number.

521
00:33:24.518 --> 00:33:26.020
Wanna go for drinks?

522
00:33:26.045 --> 00:33:27.408
I got this.

523
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:26.472
Enchantress.

524
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:29.804
God damn it!

525
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.182
June... June!

526
00:34:34.967 --> 00:34:36.673
June, I'm sorry.

527
00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:39.053
June.

528
00:34:45.966 --> 00:34:49.363
She...
She went somewhere.

529
00:34:50.675 --> 00:34:53.504
If you have to choose
between her or me...

530
00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:55.189
stop her.

531
00:34:55.214 --> 00:34:57.754
Promise me you'll stop her.

532
00:35:01.193 --> 00:35:03.407
Even if it kills me.

533
00:35:29.469 --> 00:35:30.570
Sir?

534
00:35:30.571 --> 00:35:32.232
Sir, you okay?

535
00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:33.613
Can you breathe?

536
00:35:33.614 --> 00:35:35.432
Did you take anything?

537
00:35:36.037 --> 00:35:39.192
This is 21.
Send medical to my location.

538
00:35:39.449 --> 00:35:40.749
I'm a physician.

539
00:35:40.774 --> 00:35:42.707
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.

540
00:35:42.732 --> 00:35:45.574
No pulse.
Starting compressions.

541
00:36:12.665 --> 00:36:14.016
Sir.

542
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:15.416
Midway city is under attack.

543
00:36:15.417 --> 00:36:16.999
It's a non-human entity.

544
00:36:17.024 --> 00:36:18.580
I think you know what to do, sir.

545
00:36:18.605 --> 00:36:21.199
Activate Task Force X
and get Amanda Waller

546
00:36:21.224 --> 00:36:23.137
and her whole circus
on scene ASAP.

547
00:36:23.162 --> 00:36:24.658
Yes, sir

548
00:36:26.237 --> 00:36:29.174
We're gonna live with Task Force X.
Pull 'em.

549
00:36:33.842 --> 00:36:35.598
Prisoners, get down on your knees. now!

550
00:36:35.623 --> 00:36:37.671
Down on your knees! Hands in the air!
Turn around.

551
00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:38.586
Hands up high!

552
00:36:38.587 --> 00:36:40.142
Hey, I'm cooperating.
All right?

553
00:36:40.167 --> 00:36:42.974
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

554
00:36:44.478 --> 00:36:47.065
Do not fire that goddamn weapon!

555
00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:49.419
Damn it!

556
00:36:51.047 --> 00:36:52.582
Open the gate!

557
00:36:52.583 --> 00:36:54.389
Everybody, line up for extraction.

558
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.769
Let's go!
Let's move, move!

559
00:36:56.794 --> 00:36:59.341
Yeah!
Open the door! Let's go!

560
00:36:59.366 --> 00:37:01.679
- Alright. Go! Go!
- Move it! Move it!

561
00:37:05.716 --> 00:37:06.751
Hit him!

562
00:37:06.752 --> 00:37:08.773
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

563
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.437
Where you at?

564
00:37:11.765 --> 00:37:13.120
Whoa!

565
00:37:17.865 --> 00:37:19.579
Is that the new guy?

566
00:37:23.963 --> 00:37:25.330
What is that?

567
00:37:25.331 --> 00:37:26.744
What is that?

568
00:37:26.769 --> 00:37:28.382
- Who are you?
- Standby, arming device.

569
00:37:28.407 --> 00:37:29.881
Who are you?
I don't know who you are.

570
00:37:29.882 --> 00:37:30.933
- Device armed.
- Hey.

571
00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:34.000
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

572
00:37:34.259 --> 00:37:36.135
Injection successful.

573
00:37:36.222 --> 00:37:38.281
Location verified.

574
00:37:38.306 --> 00:37:40.589
Anybody who touches me is dead.

575
00:37:40.614 --> 00:37:42.267
Anybody who tou...
Ahh!

576
00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:43.322

Oh, you deaf.

581
00:37:52.227 --> 00:37:54.291
- Oh.
- All right, all right. Come on.

582
00:37:55.364 --> 00:37:57.254
Shut up, and get it done.

583
00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.441
Weeee.

584
00:38:00.466 --> 00:38:02.360
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

585
00:38:02.385 --> 00:38:03.955
It's from Mr. J.

586
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.699
You gonna tell him
I took care of you?

587
00:38:05.724 --> 00:38:07.878
You're so screwed.

588
00:38:07.903 --> 00:38:09.790
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

589
00:38:09.815 --> 00:38:11.002
Get off me!
Get off me!

590
00:38:11.003 --> 00:38:13.187
Harley, what do you mean by that?

591
00:38:13.212 --> 00:38:14.809
Harley!

592
00:38:20.593 --> 00:38:23.835
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr.Van Criss.

593
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.856
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

594
00:38:26.857 --> 00:38:28.438
Hey, cool.
Can I leave it with you?

595
00:38:28.463 --> 00:38:30.428
I'm way behind today.

596
00:38:30.704 --> 00:38:33.081
Thank you.
You're a good man.

597
00:38:45.271 --> 00:38:46.815
Open up.

598
00:38:55.137 --> 00:38:57.702
Just please, do whatever they say.

599
00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.089
Do whatever they say.
Just do it.

600
00:39:11.094 --> 00:39:12.941
This look neat.

601
00:39:18.944 --> 00:39:21.514
Light it up! Light it up! Light it up!

602
00:39:30.414 --> 00:39:32.122
He's right above us.

603
00:39:32.147 --> 00:39:34.192
This is a mistake.
Rick, I can't do this.

604
00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:35.712
- I can't...
- Listen. Listen.

605
00:39:35.713 --> 00:39:37.614
There's no other way.

606
00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.966
Just get it done.

607
00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:43.491
Just get it done.

608
00:39:46.483 --> 00:39:48.203
Enchantress.

609
00:39:48.228 --> 00:39:50.801
Flag, talk to me.
What' going on down there?

610
00:39:51.783 --> 00:39:53.322
Amanda, she bolted.

611
00:39:53.323 --> 00:39:54.903
Say it again?

612
00:39:54.904 --> 00:39:56.521
She bolted!

613
00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:58.621
Shit!

614
00:40:59.755 --> 00:41:01.110
Go!

615
00:41:11.394 --> 00:41:13.983
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

616
00:41:14.008 --> 00:41:17.105
- I thought this was contained!
- Pull everyone back to the evacuation zone.

617
00:41:19.875 --> 00:41:22.899
Guys, I need all three of you,
follow me please.

618
00:41:23.065 --> 00:41:24.824
Anybody a universal donor?

619
00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:26.910
Anybody with blood.

620
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.017
Bring those two over here.

621
00:41:30.189 --> 00:41:31.756
Blunt trauma, right forehead!

622
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:33.710
This is the worst day of my life.

623
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.926
All evacuees must report
to a FEMA representative.

624
00:41:40.009 --> 00:41:42.155
What's going on in that city?

625
00:41:42.403 --> 00:41:44.602
Those assholes here yet?

626
00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.549
Yeah, they're here.

627
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.161
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

628
00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:55.214
What the hell, Flag?

629
00:41:57.255 --> 00:41:58.825
Unlock 'em.

630
00:42:06.695 --> 00:42:09.246
Hi, boys!
Harley Quinn.

631
00:42:09.271 --> 00:42:10.828
How do you do?

632
00:42:16.656 --> 00:42:18.041
Huh?

633
00:42:18.066 --> 00:42:19.202
What was that?

634
00:42:19.227 --> 00:42:21.622
I should kill everyone and escape?

635
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:24.677
Sorry.

636
00:42:24.896 --> 00:42:26.701
The voices.

637
00:42:27.202 --> 00:42:30.236
I'm kidding.
Jeez.

638
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:32.355
That's not what they really said.

639
00:42:32.482 --> 00:42:33.803
What do we got here?

640
00:42:33.828 --> 00:42:36.988
12 pounds of shit
in a 10-pound sack.

641
00:42:42.436 --> 00:42:45.043
Welcome to the party, Capitan Boomerang.

642
00:42:46.775 --> 00:42:48.002
Hey!

643
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.749
Hey, hey, hey...
What's going on, man?

644
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.055
Calm down.

645
00:42:52.056 --> 00:42:54.314
Hey, one minute I'm playing Mahjong
with me nanna ...

646
00:42:54.315 --> 00:42:56.626
then this red streak
hits me outta nowhere.

647
00:42:56.627 --> 00:42:59.271
Shut up!
You were caught robbing a diamond exchange.

648
00:42:59.272 --> 00:43:01.233
I was not.

649
00:43:02.457 --> 00:43:03.591
Here comes Slipknot ...

650
00:43:03.592 --> 00:43:06.691
the man who coould climb anything.
Wonderful.

651
00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:08.945
Have a good time, scumbag.

652
00:43:10.562 --> 00:43:12.060
Straighten up.

653
00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:16.283
She had a mouth.

654
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:18.358
Listen up!

655
00:43:18.383 --> 00:43:20.048
In your necks ...

656
00:43:20.766 --> 00:43:24.330
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

657
00:43:24.363 --> 00:43:28.030
it's the size of a rice grain
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

658
00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:31.675
You disobey me, you die.

659
00:43:32.608 --> 00:43:35.451
You try to escape, you die.

660
00:43:35.476 --> 00:43:40.546
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?

661
00:43:40.571 --> 00:43:41.748
You die.

662
00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:44.923
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

663
00:43:44.948 --> 00:43:46.779
Lady, shut up!

664
00:43:47.146 --> 00:43:49.110
This is the deal.

665
00:43:49.229 --> 00:43:51.981
You're going somewhere very bad...

666
00:43:51.982 --> 00:43:53.958
to do something that'll get you killed.

667
00:43:53.959 --> 00:43:56.093
But until that happens...

668
00:43:56.808 --> 00:43:58.773
you're my problem.

669
00:43:59.918 --> 00:44:02.234
So was that like a pep talk?

670
00:44:02.259 --> 00:44:03.782
Yeah.
That was a pep talk.

671
00:44:03.783 --> 00:44:05.710
There's your shit.

672
00:44:05.711 --> 00:44:08.271
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

673
00:44:08.272 --> 00:44:10.649
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

674
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.248
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

675
00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:14.496
He's like the gold standard, okay?

676
00:44:14.497 --> 00:44:17.864
Triangle, bitch.
Study

677
00:45:20.441 --> 00:45:21.950
What?

678
00:45:22.465 --> 00:45:24.812
Yo, get out of here.

679
00:45:27.915 --> 00:45:29.833
Won't fit anymore?

680
00:45:30.512 --> 00:45:32.494
Too much junk in the trunk?

681
00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:33.781
Nah.

682
00:45:33.806 --> 00:45:37.025
Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.

683
00:45:37.603 --> 00:45:39.187
And?

684
00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:41.786
I like putting it on.

685
00:45:42.157 --> 00:45:43.388
Goody.

686
00:45:43.413 --> 00:45:46.657
Something tells me a whole lotta
people are about to die.

687
00:45:46.682 --> 00:45:47.951
Yeah, it's us.

688
00:45:47.976 --> 00:45:49.601
We're being led to our deaths.

689
00:45:49.626 --> 00:45:51.244
Speak for yourself, mate.

690
00:45:51.245 --> 00:45:54.146
Hey, what's that crop on your face?
Does it wash off?

691
00:45:54.935 --> 00:45:58.210
Hey, if you like a girl, can you
light her cigarette with your pinkie?

692
00:45:58.235 --> 00:45:59.863
because that would be real classy.

693
00:45:59.864 --> 00:46:02.535
Hey, y'all might wanna
leave old boy alone.

694
00:46:02.536 --> 00:46:04.993
He could torch this whole joint.

695
00:46:04.994 --> 00:46:06.307
Ain't that right, ese?

696
00:46:06.332 --> 00:46:08.604
Ain't got nothing to worry
about from me.

697
00:46:08.864 --> 00:46:10.319
I'm cool, homie.

698
00:46:10.344 --> 00:46:13.179
Behold the voice of god.

699
00:46:15.066 --> 00:46:17.239
For those of you who
don't know me officially...

700
00:46:17.264 --> 00:46:19.619
My Name is Amanda Waller.

701
00:46:20.133 --> 00:46:23.281
There's an active terrorist event
in Midway City.

702
00:46:23.282 --> 00:46:28.285
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1 and get them to safety.

703
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.195
I'm sorry.

704
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:34.003
For those of us who don't speak good guy,
what is HVT-1?

705
00:46:34.028 --> 00:46:35.891
The only person that
matters in the city,

706
00:46:35.916 --> 00:46:38.466
the one person you can't kill.

707
00:46:38.818 --> 00:46:41.692
Complete the mission, you get
time off your prison sentence.

708
00:46:41.693 --> 00:46:43.673
Fail the mission, you die.

709
00:46:43.674 --> 00:46:45.125
Anything happens to Colonel Flag,

710
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.706
I'll kill every single one of you.

711
00:46:48.334 --> 00:46:50.610
Remember, I'm watching.

712
00:46:51.555 --> 00:46:53.596
I see everything.

713
00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.777
There's your pep talk.

714
00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:00.429
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

715
00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:02.003
So that's it?

716
00:47:02.028 --> 00:47:05.280
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

717
00:47:05.305 --> 00:47:07.807
I'll notify your next of kin.

718
00:47:09.144 --> 00:47:11.901
Alpha, Bravo team.
Mount up!

719
00:47:16.997 --> 00:47:18.431
Your' late.

720
00:47:18.456 --> 00:47:20.179
I was busy.

721
00:47:29.877 --> 00:47:31.002
I beg you.

722
00:47:31.027 --> 00:47:33.272
Please have mercy.

723
00:47:44.896 --> 00:47:46.194
This is Katana.

724
00:47:46.195 --> 00:47:47.607
She's got my back.

725
00:47:47.608 --> 00:47:50.607
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke...

726
00:47:50.632 --> 00:47:53.066
just like mowing the lawn.

727
00:47:53.091 --> 00:47:55.598
I would advise
not getting killed by her.

728
00:47:55.623 --> 00:47:59.201
Her sword traps
the souls of its victims.

729
00:47:59.365 --> 00:48:00.396
Harley Quinn.

730
00:48:00.421 --> 00:48:02.100
Nice to meet you.

731
00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:03.358
Love your perfume.

732
00:48:03.383 --> 00:48:06.023
What is that?
The stench of death?

733
00:48:08.202 --> 00:48:10.155
Whoa.
Easy, cowgirl.

734
00:48:10.156 --> 00:48:12.556
Ain't that kind of mission.
Have a seat.

735
00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:14.803
She seems nice.

736
00:48:27.106 --> 00:48:30.910
I'm coming for you.

737
00:48:34.217 --> 00:48:36.226
Shhh...

738
00:48:48.815 --> 00:48:51.886
Ooo.
Look at that pretty lights!

739
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:54.326
Are you guys seeing this?

740
00:48:55.587 --> 00:48:57.175
What happened?

741
00:48:58.316 --> 00:49:00.113
Terror attack.

742
00:49:00.114 --> 00:49:03.473
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

743
00:49:03.498 --> 00:49:05.533
You know, usual shit.

744
00:49:05.558 --> 00:49:06.897
Right.

745
00:49:07.565 --> 00:49:09.754
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

746
00:49:10.358 --> 00:49:12.719
I don't know if they told you...
but I'm a hitman.

747
00:49:12.744 --> 00:49:14.878
I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

748
00:49:14.903 --> 00:49:16.918
Anything for a dollar, right?

749
00:49:16.943 --> 00:49:19.860
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

750
00:49:19.885 --> 00:49:22.039
I'm a soldier.

751
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.045
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

752
00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.654
When the shooting starts,
and it will,

753
00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:30.168
you'll cut and run.

754
00:49:44.073 --> 00:49:45.329
6-1 is going down.

755
00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:47.670
6-1 is going down hard.

756
00:50:01.689 --> 00:50:03.547
Stand by. Drop the ramp.
Drop the ramp.

757
00:50:03.572 --> 00:50:05.965
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

758
00:50:08.513 --> 00:50:10.530
Go, go!
Come on!

759
00:50:11.062 --> 00:50:12.715
All right. All right. All right.
Relax.

760
00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.329
What a ride!

761
00:50:14.354 --> 00:50:18.451
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

762
00:50:35.255 --> 00:50:36.422
Mind games.

763
00:50:36.447 --> 00:50:40.112
- What's that?
- All this bomb in the neck crap.

764
00:50:40.399 --> 00:50:41.830
That ain't real, mate

765
00:50:41.831 --> 00:50:44.308
See, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?

766
00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:47.631
But you look around,
we're free, brah.

767
00:50:47.893 --> 00:50:49.091
How do you know this?

768
00:50:49.092 --> 00:50:51.681
Just trust me.
I know, all right? It's a con.

769
00:50:51.706 --> 00:50:54.720
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

770
00:50:54.745 --> 00:50:57.379
Question is, are you coming?

771
00:51:00.837 --> 00:51:03.224
- Yeah.
- Smart.

772
00:51:19.377 --> 00:51:20.781
Where're you going?

773
00:51:24.858 --> 00:51:26.466
Hold your fire.

774
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:31.370
Sorry.
It's what I do.

775
00:51:32.845 --> 00:51:34.810
NANITE DETONATION CONTROL
<font color="#ff8080">ARMED</font>

776
00:51:41.648 --> 00:51:43.360
Damn it.

777
00:51:44.515 --> 00:51:46.592
Now that's killer app.

778
00:51:46.617 --> 00:51:48.325
Okay.
You wanna keep playing

779
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:51.582
the Hollywood Squares version of
"I'll Blow your freaking Head Off?"

780
00:51:51.607 --> 00:51:53.358
Are you next?

781
00:51:53.383 --> 00:51:55.329
You tripping, homie.

782
00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:57.429
You next, Deadshot?

783
00:52:00.155 --> 00:52:01.545
Did you just threatened me?

784
00:52:01.546 --> 00:52:03.146
Oh, yeah.

785
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:05.038
He just threatened me.

786
00:52:08.116 --> 00:52:09.844
Move.

787
00:52:09.845 --> 00:52:11.787
You have a boyfriend?

788
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:16.745
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

789
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:20.482
Well, you better make it quick
'cause he's gonna kill all of us one by one.

790
00:52:20.513 --> 00:52:23.254
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady.
5 or 7 of these SEALs.

791
00:52:23.255 --> 00:52:25.391
After that, I'm gonna need some help,
you down?

792
00:52:25.416 --> 00:52:28.127
Always.
What about the shit in our necks?

793
00:52:28.128 --> 00:52:30.921
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

794
00:52:34.179 --> 00:52:36.797
You're my friend, too.

795
00:52:37.485 --> 00:52:40.934
Stay evil, doll face.
Spread the word.

796
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.631
I'm standing by for follow on tasking.

797
00:52:56.974 --> 00:52:59.431
C2, what is the operational load of the PLS?

798
00:52:59.456 --> 00:53:01.670
Boss, we got people up here.

799
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.653
I'm on my way.

800
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:17.252
Shit!

801
00:53:17.253 --> 00:53:19.304
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.

802
00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:21.070
Flag, get out of there.

803
00:53:21.071 --> 00:53:23.739
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

804
00:53:23.764 --> 00:53:25.415
Copy that.

805
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.027
We're diverting.

806
00:53:27.052 --> 00:53:29.651
Bump out second squad
two blocks east.

807
00:53:29.676 --> 00:53:30.912
We'll pass through you,

808
00:53:30.937 --> 00:53:32.444
continue north.

809
00:53:32.469 --> 00:53:34.045
Take Bravo two blocks east.

810
00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.121
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

811
00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:37.689
Copy that.

812
00:53:44.317 --> 00:53:45.947
Hey.

813
00:53:45.984 --> 00:53:47.546
I like these odds, mate.

814
00:53:47.571 --> 00:53:48.866
You just say the word.

815
00:53:48.891 --> 00:53:50.193
Yeah.

816
00:53:50.651 --> 00:53:52.096
Come on.

817
00:53:52.121 --> 00:53:53.625
Yeah.
Uh.

818
00:53:53.626 --> 00:53:55.431
Hold that thought.

819
00:54:04.018 --> 00:54:06.524
Rick, why do they look like that?

820
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:08.390
Stay cool.

821
00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:21.798
What the hell are they?

822
00:54:21.854 --> 00:54:24.427
You cut and run.
I'll blow your head off.

823
00:54:29.136 --> 00:54:30.811
Damn it.

824
00:54:36.013 --> 00:54:37.504
Hit 'em!

825
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.538
Huh.

826
00:55:34.232 --> 00:55:35.690
Hey.

827
00:56:01.057 --> 00:56:02.769
Get off me!

828
00:56:05.855 --> 00:56:07.894
Get off me, you son of a...

829
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.372
Flag!

830
00:56:14.555 --> 00:56:15.777
- Good riddance.
- Harley!

831
00:56:15.802 --> 00:56:17.983
He dies, we die.

832
00:56:29.502 --> 00:56:31.479
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

833
00:56:32.929 --> 00:56:34.812
Backblast, clear!

834
00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:25.018
Pinky.

835
00:57:28.605 --> 00:57:30.864
That's how I cut and run.

836
00:57:38.554 --> 00:57:40.032
Hey.

837
00:57:40.033 --> 00:57:41.307
Hey, come on.

838
00:57:41.332 --> 00:57:44.300
What?
I saw it move.

839
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:47.263
See? It flinched.
I think.

840
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.212
Hey.
You were some help, princess.

841
00:57:50.385 --> 00:57:52.232
It's better this way.

842
00:57:52.257 --> 00:57:53.263
Trust me.

843
00:57:53.288 --> 00:57:55.514
Oh, yeah.
You're the fire bloke. eh?

844
00:57:55.539 --> 00:57:58.018
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right, yeah. Hey.

845
00:57:58.873 --> 00:58:00.786
Well, look at here.

846
00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:02.494
It's fire!

847
00:58:04.853 --> 00:58:07.085
The brief said terrorist.

848
00:58:07.543 --> 00:58:10.752
- You want to start explaining this?
- If I told you, would you believe me?

849
00:58:11.918 --> 00:58:13.820
- What are they?
- I don't know.

850
00:58:13.845 --> 00:58:15.600
That's bullshit.

851
00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:18.607
Thing is, he owned a $3000 watch.

852
00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:21.441
Is that a person?

853
00:58:21.781 --> 00:58:23.395
It was.

854
00:58:23.396 --> 00:58:25.148
Now it's not.

855
00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:27.808
Hey, don't!

856
00:58:27.809 --> 00:58:29.090
What?

857
00:58:29.115 --> 00:58:31.416
We got a job to do.

858
00:58:33.597 --> 00:58:35.295
We're moving.

859
00:58:37.702 --> 00:58:39.747
Get your boys moving.

860
00:58:41.983 --> 00:58:43.575
Let's go.

861
00:58:52.336 --> 00:58:53.974
Waller, we are moving on the objective.

862
00:58:53.975 --> 00:58:56.222
We lost contact with Bravo,
you got a visual?

863
00:58:56.247 --> 00:58:58.395
Stand by.
Anything on the other squad?

864
00:58:58.396 --> 00:58:59.519
No, ma'am.

865
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.189
Go-7, I need your sensors
in those coordinates.

866
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:04.456
Flag, it's a negative.
They were engaged when you were,

867
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:06.399
but we lost them.

868
00:59:42.968 --> 00:59:44.222
Seriously?

869
00:59:44.223 --> 00:59:46.795
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

870
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:50.159
We're bad guys.
It's what we do.

871
01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.029
Take a knee.

872
01:00:17.797 --> 01:00:20.036
Our body's at the top of that building.

873
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:21.110
We get up there...

874
01:00:21.135 --> 01:00:22.734
Pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.

875
01:00:22.735 --> 01:00:24.634
Helos extract us off the roof.

876
01:00:24.659 --> 01:00:26.960
- It's Miller time.
- Check

877
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.123
Waller?

878
01:00:41.148 --> 01:00:44.626
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.

879
01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.579
What do say
we get this over with?

880
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.087
What the hell?
Deadshot.

881
01:00:51.088 --> 01:00:52.603
Fall back.

882
01:00:58.214 --> 01:01:00.512
You mind if we tag along?

883
01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:16.541
Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

884
01:01:16.566 --> 01:01:18.625
Be a walk in the park.

885
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:20.340
Easy peasy.

886
01:01:20.365 --> 01:01:22.721
Don't make me shoot you.

887
01:01:27.787 --> 01:01:29.771
God damn it.
Harley!

888
01:01:29.796 --> 01:01:31.746
Go. Go. Go.
Go. Go.

889
01:01:35.408 --> 01:01:38.042
I am close be ready...

890
01:02:19.176 --> 01:02:20.641
Hey, guys!

891
01:02:26.918 --> 01:02:28.818
Come on.
Let's go.

892
01:02:37.466 --> 01:02:38.311
Ma'am.

893
01:02:38.336 --> 01:02:41.422
I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.

894
01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.623
Flag.

895
01:02:44.648 --> 01:02:46.292
- They're all around you.
- Hold.

896
01:02:46.317 --> 01:02:48.752
Use extreme caution.

897
01:02:49.872 --> 01:02:52.006
I don't like this, Flag.

898
01:02:53.005 --> 01:02:54.892
I don't like it either.

899
01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:00.409
Pussy.

900
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.635
I will knock your ass out.

901
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.046
I do not care
that you're a girl.

902
01:03:54.676 --> 01:03:56.809
They're after Flag again!

903
01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:59.396
Son of a bitch!
Get off me!

904
01:04:03.249 --> 01:04:05.623
Circle up!
Circle around him!

905
01:04:10.202 --> 01:04:11.272
Let me fight!

906
01:04:11.297 --> 01:04:13.491
You die, we die.

907
01:04:15.905 --> 01:04:18.544
Clear!
Everyone move out.

908
01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:34.023
- Where've you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

909
01:04:34.024 --> 01:04:35.568
You know what?
You don't stand for shit.

910
01:04:35.593 --> 01:04:37.122
You ain't about shit!

911
01:04:37.147 --> 01:04:38.107
Don't touch me, man!

912
01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:39.144
- Don't touch you?
- Don't touch me!

913
01:04:39.169 --> 01:04:41.500
What you gonna do?
I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

914
01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:42.593
- Do something.
- Don't touch me!

915
01:04:42.618 --> 01:04:43.351
Do something!

916
01:04:43.376 --> 01:04:44.749
- You wanna see something?
- Yeah, I wanna see...

917
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.136
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something!

918
01:05:11.256 --> 01:05:13.532
I was just trying
to get you there.

919
01:05:14.468 --> 01:05:16.694
Phil Jackson, we good, right?

920
01:05:18.216 --> 01:05:20.772
I knew you'd come through.

921
01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:23.187
That's shit crazy.

922
01:05:32.769 --> 01:05:34.286
Clear.

923
01:05:47.488 --> 01:05:49.780
I gotta work on my cardio.

924
01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:01.702
Question.

925
01:06:03.511 --> 01:06:05.872
Would you die for me?

926
01:06:07.785 --> 01:06:08.811
Yes.

927
01:06:08.836 --> 01:06:10.921
That's too easy.

928
01:06:11.387 --> 01:06:13.309
Would you...

929
01:06:15.228 --> 01:06:18.010
Would you live for me?

930
01:06:19.204 --> 01:06:20.478
Hm?

931
01:06:20.503 --> 01:06:21.876
Yes

932
01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:24.199
Careful.

933
01:06:24.402 --> 01:06:29.666
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

934
01:06:30.939 --> 01:06:32.217
Desire becomes surrender.

935
01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:34.887
Surrender becomes power.

936
01:06:37.964 --> 01:06:39.856
You want this?

937
01:06:40.704 --> 01:06:41.725
I do.

938
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:43.188
Say it.

939
01:06:43.381 --> 01:06:46.151
Say it.
Say it.

940
01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:48.859
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty...

941
01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.351
Please.

942
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:53.424
God, you're so...

943
01:06:53.449 --> 01:06:55.103
good.

944
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:02.834
Oh, relax.

945
01:08:02.859 --> 01:08:04.409
It's just me.

946
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.232
You ever been in love?

947
01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.664
Nah, never.

948
01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.074
Bullshit.

949
01:08:15.099 --> 01:08:19.129
You don't kill as many people as
I've killed and still sleep like a kitten

950
01:08:19.154 --> 01:08:21.543
If you feel shit like love.

951
01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.062
Another textbook sociopath.

952
01:08:29.402 --> 01:08:30.538
Clear.

953
01:08:30.674 --> 01:08:32.166
Clear.

954
01:08:33.361 --> 01:08:34.300
- Nice.
- Clear the roof.

955
01:08:34.325 --> 01:08:37.323
Sweep for shooters so we can
bring in our aviation assets.

956
01:08:37.348 --> 01:08:38.786
Go to the roof.

957
01:08:45.083 --> 01:08:46.226
Just oh...

958
01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:47.309
Wait here.

959
01:08:47.334 --> 01:08:48.336
Please.

960
01:08:48.361 --> 01:08:51.024
I don't wanna gave this dude
a heart attack, okay?

961
01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.042
Aww.
He's embarrassed of us.

962
01:08:54.067 --> 01:08:55.667
Hey, Flag.

963
01:08:55.692 --> 01:08:58.706
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

964
01:09:04.861 --> 01:09:07.777
You ready?
Let's go.

965
01:09:07.922 --> 01:09:10.126
You wouldn't have made it
without them.

966
01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:13.164
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

967
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:16.201
Admit it, Rick.
I was right.

968
01:09:16.226 --> 01:09:17.758
Yeah, I told you to get on
the damn truck.

969
01:09:17.783 --> 01:09:18.576
Why did you stay?

970
01:09:18.601 --> 01:09:20.731
I was studying your girlfriend.

971
01:09:20.761 --> 01:09:22.363
She takes an average person...

972
01:09:22.364 --> 01:09:25.665
A yoga mom, an elderly retiree
and she turns them into a soldier

973
01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:28.194
who can take a headshot
and still fight.

974
01:09:28.219 --> 01:09:30.274
It's an instant army.

975
01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:32.683
How'd she do it, Flag?

976
01:09:32.708 --> 01:09:36.369
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

977
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:41.414
I'll accept the consequences

978
01:09:41.415 --> 01:09:43.104
I am your consequence.

979
01:09:43.129 --> 01:09:45.478
You might need to be careful.

980
01:09:45.503 --> 01:09:47.929
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

981
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.470
I can take care of myself.

982
01:09:49.495 --> 01:09:51.361
- Shut it down, wipe the drivers.
- Yes, ma'am.

983
01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:52.899
Copy that.

984
01:09:53.698 --> 01:09:55.062
Hey man,
I know you can't hear me

985
01:09:55.087 --> 01:09:59.084
'cause you're trapped in your
temple of soldierly self- righteousness.

986
01:09:59.109 --> 01:10:02.466
But a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

987
01:10:02.491 --> 01:10:04.572
Oh, says the guy
who shoots people for money.

988
01:10:04.597 --> 01:10:05.988
My cards is on the table, man.

989
01:10:06.013 --> 01:10:08.080
It got done, didn't it?

990
01:10:13.068 --> 01:10:15.449
Damn.
That is just...

991
01:10:15.474 --> 01:10:18.587
a mean lady.

992
01:10:18.588 --> 01:10:21.210
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

993
01:10:21.935 --> 01:10:23.942
And I'm the bad guy?

994
01:10:27.995 --> 01:10:29.777
That's gangsta.

995
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.726
What?

996
01:10:31.751 --> 01:10:33.793
They weren't cleared
for any of this, any of it.

997
01:10:33.818 --> 01:10:37.065
I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes too.

998
01:10:47.015 --> 01:10:49.292
No way.

999
01:10:58.718 --> 01:11:00.389
Let's go home.

1000
01:11:00.414 --> 01:11:02.266
Yeah, let's go home.

1001
01:11:02.537 --> 01:11:05.097
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home?

1002
01:11:06.119 --> 01:11:07.643
Or you wanna go back to prison?

1003
01:11:07.668 --> 01:11:09.655
I'm not going back to prison.

1004
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.911
What I'm saying is...

1005
01:11:10.936 --> 01:11:13.899
We kill the pair of 'em now
before they kill us.

1006
01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:16.429
I got this.

1007
01:11:18.658 --> 01:11:20.984
You all made it this far.

1008
01:11:21.369 --> 01:11:25.434
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.

1009
01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:43.214
I like her.

1010
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.277
Savior 1-0, this is Ground Element.

1011
01:11:52.217 --> 01:11:54.913
Savior 1-0,
how copy?

1012
01:11:56.383 --> 01:11:59.685
Savior 1-0, the LZ's clear.

1013
01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:06.630
Boss, they're not talking to me.

1014
01:12:07.754 --> 01:12:09.800
Our bird's been jacked.

1015
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:12.240
Light it up!

1016
01:12:37.923 --> 01:12:40.002
What?
I got a hickey or something?

1017
01:12:40.027 --> 01:12:42.681
Professor, could you pick up the pace?

1018
01:12:42.706 --> 01:12:44.084
<font color="#80ff80">DISARMED</font>

1019
01:12:45.387 --> 01:12:46.846
NOW!

1020
01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.651
Harley!

1021
01:12:58.518 --> 01:13:00.204
Hello, baby.

1022
01:13:02.398 --> 01:13:03.738
Kill her!

1023
01:13:03.763 --> 01:13:05.403
FAIL - SAFE MODE

1024
01:13:05.428 --> 01:13:08.068
Her nanite's disarmed!

1025
01:13:09.605 --> 01:13:11.485
Come on, baby.

1026
01:13:26.553 --> 01:13:28.127
Deadshot...

1027
01:13:28.573 --> 01:13:30.697
Shoot that woman, right now!

1028
01:13:30.722 --> 01:13:32.656
She ain't do shit to me.

1029
01:13:32.681 --> 01:13:34.622
You're a hitman, right?

1030
01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.209
I got a contract.

1031
01:13:36.234 --> 01:13:37.934
Kill Harley Quinn.

1032
01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:40.751
Do it your freedom
and your kid.

1033
01:13:42.115 --> 01:13:43.983
Now she dead.

1034
01:14:23.518 --> 01:14:25.154
I missed.

1035
01:14:29.844 --> 01:14:31.210
Good one, mate.

1036
01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:32.922
It's Waller.

1037
01:14:32.947 --> 01:14:36.762
Savior 1-0's been hijaked.
Shoot it down.

1038
01:14:36.787 --> 01:14:39.232
Rager that, ma'am.
Going hot.

1039
01:14:46.632 --> 01:14:48.232
Puddin'!

1040
01:14:53.025 --> 01:14:54.944
You got all dressed up for me?

1041
01:14:54.976 --> 01:14:57.498
Oh, you know I'd do
anything for you.

1042
01:14:57.523 --> 01:14:58.615
By the way...

1043
01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.153
I've got some grape soda on ice,
and a bear skin rug waiting.

1044
01:15:02.154 --> 01:15:03.496
Yeah?

1045
01:15:03.521 --> 01:15:05.717
Boss, we got a problem!

1046
01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:14.134
- This bird is baked.
- No.

1047
01:15:15.286 --> 01:15:18.008
Okay, honey.
It's me and you.

1048
01:15:18.033 --> 01:15:19.724
Let's do it.

1049
01:15:45.713 --> 01:15:47.273
Target destroyed, ma'am

1050
01:15:47.298 --> 01:15:50.014
Thank you.
Now get me off this roof.

1051
01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:52.389
Yes, ma'am.
We're inbound.

1052
01:15:55.242 --> 01:15:58.136
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

1053
01:16:02.571 --> 01:16:04.488
You couldn't save her.

1054
01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:11.679
Roger, I see you.

1055
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:15.153
Watch your step, ma'am.

1056
01:16:16.563 --> 01:16:19.600
Standby, I'll send another helo!

1057
01:17:20.226 --> 01:17:21.997
Waller's down.

1058
01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:23.914
It's over.

1059
01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:27.805
Ops just confirmed.
She's down, 1k west.

1060
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.035
Let's go get her.

1061
01:17:37.237 --> 01:17:38.961
The mission's not over.

1062
01:17:38.986 --> 01:17:42.320
Nah, it is for me.
We had a deal.

1063
01:17:42.345 --> 01:17:44.611
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1064
01:18:30.211 --> 01:18:33.206
Hey, guys.
I'm back!

1065
01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:37.610
I missed you all so much.

1066
01:18:37.782 --> 01:18:39.902
We're glad you could make it.

1067
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:56.352
Hey, craziness.

1068
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:46.355
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1069
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.283
Now tell me how to
destroy your armies.

1070
01:19:50.308 --> 01:19:52.897
Do your worst, bitch!

1071
01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:22.673
So, let me guess.

1072
01:20:23.175 --> 01:20:26.686
We're going to the swirling
ring of trash in the sky.

1073
01:20:26.687 --> 01:20:28.799
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?

1074
01:20:30.883 --> 01:20:32.971
When does this end, Flag?

1075
01:20:32.996 --> 01:20:35.403
Load up.
We're in for a fight.

1076
01:20:50.315 --> 01:20:53.537
<font color="#ff8080">TOP SECRET</font>

1077
01:20:59.849 --> 01:21:03.332
You tell everybody, everything.

1078
01:21:03.357 --> 01:21:05.800
Or me and you are
gonna go right now.

1079
01:21:12.163 --> 01:21:13.270
3 days ago,

1080
01:21:13.271 --> 01:21:16.819
a non-human entity
appeared in the subway station.

1081
01:21:17.526 --> 01:21:19.290
Waller, we're almost there.

1082
01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:23.438
So Waller sent me and
a woman with incredibles abilities.

1083
01:21:23.463 --> 01:21:25.815
Enchantress

1084
01:21:26.109 --> 01:21:27.733
A witch.

1085
01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:30.831
See, nobody could get near this thing,
but...

1086
01:21:30.856 --> 01:21:32.650
the witch could.

1087
01:21:34.066 --> 01:21:35.369
Bomb's ready.

1088
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:36.986
Set for two seconds.

1089
01:21:37.011 --> 01:21:39.245
You just press the
button and drop it.

1090
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:45.484
Needless to say
the whole thing was a bad idea.

1091
01:21:45.509 --> 01:21:47.046
She bolted!

1092
01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:48.729
Shit!

1093
01:21:56.382 --> 01:21:58.961
And that's how
she escaped from Waller.

1094
01:22:01.523 --> 01:22:03.226
So now you know.

1095
01:22:04.358 --> 01:22:07.497
You can just kill me right now
but...

1096
01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:09.466
I'm going to have a drink.

1097
01:22:09.622 --> 01:22:11.674
Hey, Deadshot,
I need your help.

1098
01:22:11.675 --> 01:22:14.673
No, sir.
You need a miracle.

1099
01:22:48.626 --> 01:22:52.258
Here's to honor among thieves

1100
01:22:52.283 --> 01:22:54.094
I'm not a thief.

1101
01:22:55.657 --> 01:22:58.646
Oh.
She's not a thief.

1102
01:23:02.874 --> 01:23:05.325
Well, we almost pulled it off.

1103
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:08.136
Despite what everybody thought.

1104
01:23:08.672 --> 01:23:12.480
Worst part of it is, they're gonna
blame us for the whole thing.

1105
01:23:12.505 --> 01:23:15.198
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.

1106
01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:16.900
We're the patsies.

1107
01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:18.499
The cover-up.

1108
01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.872
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

1109
01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:30.419
For about 2 sweet seconds...

1110
01:23:30.444 --> 01:23:32.116
I had hope.

1111
01:23:32.726 --> 01:23:34.669
You had hope, huh?

1112
01:23:36.018 --> 01:23:39.199
Hope don't stop the wheel
from turning, my brother.

1113
01:23:39.402 --> 01:23:40.446
You preaching?

1114
01:23:40.471 --> 01:23:42.725
It's coming back around for you.

1115
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:45.626
How many people you killed, man?

1116
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:48.623
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1117
01:23:48.648 --> 01:23:51.271
You ain't ever
whacked down no women.

1118
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:53.344
No kids.

1119
01:23:54.456 --> 01:23:56.883
I don't kill women or children.

1120
01:23:57.085 --> 01:23:58.656
I do.

1121
01:24:01.019 --> 01:24:03.631
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

1122
01:24:03.804 --> 01:24:06.920
I kept it hidden most of my life, but...

1123
01:24:07.577 --> 01:24:10.473
The older I got,
the stronger I got.

1124
01:24:10.498 --> 01:24:12.820
So I started using it.

1125
01:24:13.395 --> 01:24:15.401
For business, you know

1126
01:24:16.039 --> 01:24:17.524
The more power
on the street I got

1127
01:24:17.549 --> 01:24:18.765
the more firepower I got.

1128
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:20.047
Like that shit
went hand in hand.

1129
01:24:20.072 --> 01:24:22.487
You know, one was feeding the other.

1130
01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:26.103
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1131
01:24:26.889 --> 01:24:28.730
Except my old lady.

1132
01:24:31.002 --> 01:24:33.665
You know, she used to pray for me.

1133
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:35.263
You're welcome.

1134
01:24:37.055 --> 01:24:39.228
Even when I didn't want it.

1135
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:43.310
SIX DIE IN ARSON  FIRE

1136
01:24:48.903 --> 01:24:51.164
God didn't give me this.

1137
01:24:51.517 --> 01:24:53.886
Why should he take it away?

1138
01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.369
Hey.

1139
01:24:58.252 --> 01:24:59.532
This is our home.

1140
01:24:59.557 --> 01:25:01.052
You put that back
where you found it.

1141
01:25:01.077 --> 01:25:02.826
I'm taking my kids to Mom's.

1142
01:25:02.851 --> 01:25:04.839
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

1143
01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:06.846
See, when I get mad,
I lose control.

1144
01:25:06.871 --> 01:25:08.598
You know, I just...

1145
01:25:09.352 --> 01:25:11.443
I don't know what I do...

1146
01:25:17.401 --> 01:25:19.250
till it's done.

1147
01:25:33.822 --> 01:25:35.496
And the kids?

1148
01:25:38.356 --> 01:25:40.498
He killed them.

1149
01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:45.491
Didn't you?

1150
01:25:53.339 --> 01:25:55.534
Own that shit.

1151
01:25:56.085 --> 01:25:57.250
Own it!

1152
01:25:57.251 --> 01:25:59.757
What'd you think was
gonna happen, huh?

1153
01:25:59.758 --> 01:26:01.571
Hey, Harley.
Come on.

1154
01:26:01.596 --> 01:26:03.528
What you were just...

1155
01:26:03.553 --> 01:26:05.114
thinking you can have a happy family...

1156
01:26:05.139 --> 01:26:08.212
and coach little leagues
and make car payments?

1157
01:26:08.237 --> 01:26:12.598
Normal is a setting on the dryer.
People like us, we don't get normal!

1158
01:26:12.623 --> 01:26:15.081
Why is it always a knife fight…

1159
01:26:15.106 --> 01:26:18.239
every single time
you open your mouth?

1160
01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.233
You know, outside you're amazing.

1161
01:26:24.371 --> 01:26:27.363
But inside, you're ugly.

1162
01:26:27.364 --> 01:26:29.323
We all are.

1163
01:26:29.348 --> 01:26:31.585
We all are!

1164
01:26:31.952 --> 01:26:33.641
Except for him.

1165
01:26:34.561 --> 01:26:36.475
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1166
01:26:36.476 --> 01:26:38.869
Not me, shorty.

1167
01:26:42.577 --> 01:26:44.919
I'm beautiful.

1168
01:26:44.944 --> 01:26:47.186
Yeah, you are.

1169
01:26:57.114 --> 01:26:59.593
We don't want you here.

1170
01:27:06.127 --> 01:27:10.122
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1171
01:27:11.337 --> 01:27:12.937
Yeah.

1172
01:27:13.982 --> 01:27:17.186
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

1173
01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:23.424
Apparently that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1174
01:27:23.449 --> 01:27:26.314
‘Cause the witch is scared of him.

1175
01:27:26.339 --> 01:27:28.863
The only woman I ever cared about...

1176
01:27:28.888 --> 01:27:31.192
is trapped inside that monster.

1177
01:27:31.217 --> 01:27:36.345
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.
Everything is over.

1178
01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:38.120
Everything.

1179
01:27:40.892 --> 01:27:42.627
You're free to go.

1180
01:27:56.502 --> 01:27:59.337
Your daughter writes you everyday.

1181
01:28:02.598 --> 01:28:04.807
Every single day.

1182
01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:22.259
You had these the whole time?

1183
01:28:23.406 --> 01:28:27.034
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?

1184
01:28:31.096 --> 01:28:33.054
I'm gonna get you there.

1185
01:28:33.604 --> 01:28:35.521
And you're gonna end this.

1186
01:28:35.546 --> 01:28:38.329
I'm gonna carry your ass
if I have to.

1187
01:28:39.222 --> 01:28:42.813
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1188
01:28:42.814 --> 01:28:45.507
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

1189
01:28:45.809 --> 01:28:49.170
And my daughter is gonna know
that her daddy…

1190
01:28:49.195 --> 01:28:51.638
is not a piece of shit.

1191
01:29:00.517 --> 01:29:02.008
I'll come.

1192
01:29:05.835 --> 01:29:07.316
What?

1193
01:29:07.494 --> 01:29:09.293
You got something better to do?

1194
01:29:09.318 --> 01:29:10.780
Come on!

1195
01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:14.128
Pussies.

1196
01:29:49.294 --> 01:29:51.479
We think that thing's a weapon.

1197
01:29:52.007 --> 01:29:53.777
Here, lower.

1198
01:30:00.765 --> 01:30:03.031
We gotta take out the big one.

1199
01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:09.337
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1200
01:30:09.907 --> 01:30:11.398
There's a flooded tunnel...

1201
01:30:11.423 --> 01:30:13.366
leads right underneath that building.

1202
01:30:13.391 --> 01:30:18.012
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim underneath that thing's feet.

1203
01:30:18.037 --> 01:30:20.980
We get in it's face and distract
the hell out of that son of a bitch

1204
01:30:21.005 --> 01:30:23.126
so the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1205
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:26.080
That's how we take it out.

1206
01:30:36.558 --> 01:30:38.975
I'm going with you.

1207
01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.727
We got this.

1208
01:30:41.847 --> 01:30:44.690
I'm not asking, bro.

1209
01:30:47.366 --> 01:30:49.818
I live underground.

1210
01:30:49.819 --> 01:30:53.004
Y'all are just tourists.

1211
01:31:17.165 --> 01:31:19.995
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1212
01:31:21.294 --> 01:31:24.172
His soul's trapped inside of it.

1213
01:31:24.197 --> 01:31:26.152
She talks to him.

1214
01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:28.183
Hey. well...

1215
01:31:28.208 --> 01:31:30.901
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1216
01:31:32.166 --> 01:31:33.649
Huh?

1217
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:42.334
Let's do this.

1218
01:32:24.625 --> 01:32:26.625
You gonna fight with us?

1219
01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:28.966
What if I lose control?

1220
01:32:28.991 --> 01:32:31.504
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1221
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:45.570
Duck in.

1222
01:32:57.432 --> 01:33:01.521
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff right?

1223
01:33:01.546 --> 01:33:03.115
Yeah, why?

1224
01:33:03.451 --> 01:33:05.441
I'm off my meds.

1225
01:33:06.811 --> 01:33:08.802
That's your old lady, huh?

1226
01:33:08.803 --> 01:33:09.744
Yeah.

1227
01:33:09.769 --> 01:33:12.088
Well, you need to handle this shit, alll right?

1228
01:33:12.113 --> 01:33:14.340
Get up there,
smack on her ass,

1229
01:33:14.341 --> 01:33:15.985
tell her knock this shit off.

1230
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:18.193
I do not think that'd be wise.

1231
01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:20.407
I'm gonna draw out
the big one.

1232
01:33:20.408 --> 01:33:23.530
My boys will detonate
the bomb underneath him.

1233
01:33:27.317 --> 01:33:30.467
You know, we should
get a drink sometime.

1234
01:33:30.789 --> 01:33:34.658
I've been waiting for you all night.

1235
01:33:35.144 --> 01:33:37.031
Step out of the shadows.

1236
01:33:37.032 --> 01:33:39.764
I won't bite.

1237
01:33:42.848 --> 01:33:45.165
What the hell?
Grab her.

1238
01:33:46.159 --> 01:33:48.970
Why are you here?

1239
01:33:48.995 --> 01:33:51.825
Because the soldier led you?

1240
01:33:51.850 --> 01:33:53.757
And all for Waller?

1241
01:33:53.782 --> 01:33:56.870
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1242
01:33:56.895 --> 01:33:59.248
I am your ally.

1243
01:33:59.273 --> 01:34:01.972
And I know what you want.

1244
01:34:01.997 --> 01:34:05.823
Exactly what you want.

1245
01:34:18.202 --> 01:34:19.340
Normal

1246
01:34:19.365 --> 01:34:20.680
<font color="#0080c0">Normal</font>

1247
01:34:46.517 --> 01:34:47.862
Baby.

1248
01:34:49.064 --> 01:34:52.557
Baby.
It's just a nightmare.

1249
01:34:53.067 --> 01:34:55.227
It's just a bad dream.

1250
01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:57.055
I'm here.

1251
01:35:07.383 --> 01:35:08.913
Miss me?

1252
01:35:15.930 --> 01:35:19.986
I'll put the kids to sleep and then...
maybe we can kick it?

1253
01:35:21.153 --> 01:35:22.805
Yeah?

1254
01:35:24.162 --> 01:35:27.898
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!

1255
01:35:28.179 --> 01:35:30.535
He married me.

1256
01:35:31.907 --> 01:35:33.391
It's not real.

1257
01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:34.957
I killed the Bat.

1258
01:35:34.982 --> 01:35:36.940
No, homie, you don't want that.

1259
01:35:36.965 --> 01:35:38.719
What?
I want that.

1260
01:35:38.744 --> 01:35:41.543
She's trying to play games with you, man.
It's not real!

1261
01:35:41.568 --> 01:35:43.185
He's right.

1262
01:35:43.210 --> 01:35:45.173
It's not real.

1263
01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:50.305
How long have you been
able to see?

1264
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:52.143
My whole life.

1265
01:35:52.976 --> 01:35:54.784
You can't have them.

1266
01:35:54.809 --> 01:35:56.494
These are my people right here.

1267
01:35:56.519 --> 01:35:58.475
But it is our time.

1268
01:35:58.476 --> 01:36:01.263
The sun is setting
and the magic rises.

1269
01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:04.355
The metahumans are a sign of change.

1270
01:36:04.778 --> 01:36:05.859
Lady...

1271
01:36:05.884 --> 01:36:08.678
You are EVIL!

1272
01:36:13.211 --> 01:36:14.877
Oh, wow!

1273
01:36:17.484 --> 01:36:19.300
Uh-oh.

1274
01:36:19.325 --> 01:36:20.931
Who is this?

1275
01:36:20.956 --> 01:36:22.054
It's gonna be bad!

1276
01:36:22.079 --> 01:36:23.810
We should run.

1277
01:36:35.327 --> 01:36:37.675
GQ, come in.
We're in position.

1278
01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:48.714
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

1279
01:36:48.715 --> 01:36:51.344
I'll do it!
I'll get him there!

1280
01:37:04.459 --> 01:37:06.527
I lost one family.
I ain't gonaa lose one another.

1281
01:37:06.528 --> 01:37:08.053
Look, think it through.

1282
01:37:08.078 --> 01:37:09.522
I got this.

1283
01:37:09.547 --> 01:37:11.892
Let me show you
what I really am.

1284
01:37:13.201 --> 01:37:14.854
Over here!

1285
01:37:56.463 --> 01:37:58.342
Go!

1286
01:38:12.092 --> 01:38:14.000
Rick, in position.
Standing by.

1287
01:38:14.001 --> 01:38:16.629
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1288
01:38:30.587 --> 01:38:32.182
Get him mate.
- Come on.

1289
01:38:33.634 --> 01:38:35.672
Yeah, do it!

1290
01:38:45.361 --> 01:38:47.589
Diablo, get clear!
Get out of there!

1291
01:38:47.614 --> 01:38:49.375
Blow it!

1292
01:38:52.112 --> 01:38:53.588
Blow it.

1293
01:38:55.699 --> 01:38:57.493
Now GQ, now.

1294
01:38:57.518 --> 01:38:58.959
No!

1295
01:38:59.921 --> 01:39:02.304
Everybody down!

1296
01:39:39.208 --> 01:39:40.808
You next.

1297
01:39:42.046 --> 01:39:44.961
My spell is complete.

1298
01:39:44.986 --> 01:39:49.002
Once you and armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1299
01:39:49.027 --> 01:39:53.140
And it would be mine to rule.

1300
01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:10.355
That was our main satellite uplink.

1301
01:40:14.752 --> 01:40:16.683
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?

1302
01:40:16.684 --> 01:40:19.034
It's a secret facility.

1303
01:40:23.268 --> 01:40:25.367
You got a move here, Flag?

1304
01:40:25.392 --> 01:40:28.136
We gotta cut her heart out!

1305
01:40:55.147 --> 01:40:56.425
Where is she?

1306
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.963
I can't see her!

1307
01:40:58.433 --> 01:41:00.376
While we're fighting,
that thing is laying waste

1308
01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:02.842
to the whole damn world.

1309
01:41:09.806 --> 01:41:11.327
Where is she?

1310
01:41:11.352 --> 01:41:13.209
I don't know.

1311
01:41:16.856 --> 01:41:19.457
Hey.
Oh shit.

1312
01:41:24.573 --> 01:41:26.327
Look out, look out!

1313
01:41:48.932 --> 01:41:50.355
Uh-oh.

1314
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.982
Sorry.

1315
01:41:56.966 --> 01:41:58.615
Flag!

1316
01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:34.642
Enough!

1317
01:42:37.696 --> 01:42:39.996
Of all who have faced me...

1318
01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:42.916
you have earned mercy.

1319
01:42:42.941 --> 01:42:45.591
For the last time...

1320
01:42:45.616 --> 01:42:47.548
join me...

1321
01:42:47.573 --> 01:42:49.913
or die.

1322
01:42:51.232 --> 01:42:54.309
I'm not much of a joiner
but...

1323
01:42:55.127 --> 01:42:57.184
maybe we should.

1324
01:42:57.299 --> 01:42:58.762
Hey.

1325
01:42:58.763 --> 01:43:00.685
She's trying to take over the world.

1326
01:43:00.710 --> 01:43:02.306
So?

1327
01:43:02.421 --> 01:43:04.534
What's the world ever
done for us anyway?

1328
01:43:04.535 --> 01:43:06.493
It hates us.

1329
01:43:06.518 --> 01:43:08.901
Hey.
Harley.

1330
01:43:11.388 --> 01:43:13.357
Hey, lady?

1331
01:43:15.987 --> 01:43:18.446
I lost my Puddin'.

1332
01:43:19.489 --> 01:43:22.082
But you can get him back, right?

1333
01:43:22.107 --> 01:43:24.642
I can, my dear.

1334
01:43:24.667 --> 01:43:28.448
Anything you want.

1335
01:43:30.365 --> 01:43:31.571
You promise?

1336
01:43:31.596 --> 01:43:34.110
Yes, child.

1337
01:43:34.993 --> 01:43:37.736
You need only bow...

1338
01:43:37.761 --> 01:43:41.995
and serve beneath my feet.

1339
01:43:46.497 --> 01:43:49.360
I like what you're selling, lady.

1340
01:43:49.527 --> 01:43:53.818
There's only one teeny problem.

1341
01:43:54.509 --> 01:43:56.844
You messed with my friends.

1342
01:44:01.656 --> 01:44:04.761
Her heart's out!
We can ends this.

1343
01:44:08.248 --> 01:44:09.944
Hey, Croc!

1344
01:44:13.206 --> 01:44:14.991
Harley!

1345
01:44:58.889 --> 01:45:01.843
Please, Daddy.
Don't do it.

1346
01:45:02.701 --> 01:45:06.860
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1347
01:45:07.312 --> 01:45:09.606
Daddy, I love you.

1348
01:45:09.979 --> 01:45:12.399
Please, don't do this.

1349
01:46:06.814 --> 01:46:08.052
That was a great shot, man.

1350
01:46:08.077 --> 01:46:10.480
Hey, I don't do hugs.
I'm not a hugger.

1351
01:46:10.505 --> 01:46:13.533
I'm not a hugger.
All right?

1352
01:46:19.943 --> 01:46:22.856
Let me join my brother.

1353
01:46:23.402 --> 01:46:25.002
Katana, no!

1354
01:46:29.899 --> 01:46:31.623
Give me that.

1355
01:46:32.785 --> 01:46:34.660
You bring June back.

1356
01:46:34.685 --> 01:46:35.720
You bring her back.

1357
01:46:35.745 --> 01:46:38.236
She's not coming back.

1358
01:46:38.237 --> 01:46:39.265
I'll crush this.

1359
01:46:39.266 --> 01:46:40.524
Do you hear me?

1360
01:46:40.549 --> 01:46:42.534
You bring June back
or I'll crush this!

1361
01:46:42.559 --> 01:46:44.823
Go ahead.

1362
01:46:45.077 --> 01:46:48.187
You don't have the balls.

1363
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:41.705
Hey, Flag.

1364
01:47:50.747 --> 01:47:52.280
June.

1365
01:48:01.236 --> 01:48:02.947
She's gone.

1366
01:48:02.972 --> 01:48:04.648
I thought I killed you.

1367
01:48:04.673 --> 01:48:06.804
I thought I killed you.

1368
01:48:07.544 --> 01:48:12.724
Y'all don't mind.
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1369
01:48:12.762 --> 01:48:15.334
Yeah, and I got some business
to handle back in Gotham.

1370
01:48:15.335 --> 01:48:17.285
I'm going to hotwire a car
Need a ride?

1371
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:18.522
Your ass is not driving.

1372
01:48:18.547 --> 01:48:19.898
Why not?

1373
01:48:21.938 --> 01:48:24.721
How are you not dead?

1374
01:48:24.746 --> 01:48:27.400
We-We just saved the world.

1375
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:29.791
A "Thank you" would be nice.

1376
01:48:29.809 --> 01:48:31.789
Thank you.

1377
01:48:31.858 --> 01:48:33.154
You're welcome.

1378
01:48:33.179 --> 01:48:35.244
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1379
01:48:35.269 --> 01:48:38.112
10 years off you prison sentences.

1380
01:48:40.963 --> 01:48:44.612
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1381
01:48:46.308 --> 01:48:48.403
That can be arranged.

1382
01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:51.212
An other requests?

1383
01:48:51.247 --> 01:48:53.302
An espresso machine.

1384
01:48:53.327 --> 01:48:55.352
BET.

1385
01:48:55.734 --> 01:48:58.525
10 years off a triple life sentence?

1386
01:48:58.550 --> 01:49:00.336
Darling, I'm walking out of here
a free man.

1387
01:49:00.361 --> 01:49:02.520
Or we're to start having
some real fun.

1388
01:49:02.545 --> 01:49:05.312
Why don't have some fun?

1389
01:49:14.302 --> 01:49:17.754
You're trying to figure out this length.

1390
01:49:17.779 --> 01:49:19.097
That's the hypotenuse.

1391
01:49:19.122 --> 01:49:20.933
So you have to know this angle.

1392
01:49:20.958 --> 01:49:24.011
Okay.
So, if you're up here...

1393
01:49:24.036 --> 01:49:25.480
- like an a building.
- Mm.

1394
01:49:25.505 --> 01:49:28.742
And you shoot a man down here
on the street...

1395
01:49:28.767 --> 01:49:31.497
That's how far
the bullet actually goes?

1396
01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:33.859
Yeah.
That's-That's right!

1397
01:49:33.884 --> 01:49:35.560
You are so smart.
Right.

1398
01:49:35.585 --> 01:49:38.189
The hypotenuse, good one.

1399
01:49:39.025 --> 01:49:41.049
So that would make you
have to know the angle

1400
01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:43.479
between the building
and the sidewalk.

1401
01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.944
You got to know that angle.

1402
01:49:44.969 --> 01:49:46.418
You know,
I mean, in real life

1403
01:49:46.443 --> 01:49:47.979
you got-you got variables.

1404
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.392
You know, you got rifling twist.

1405
01:49:49.417 --> 01:49:52.695
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1406
01:49:52.832 --> 01:49:56.886
Some shots you'll even have to take
the curvature of the earth in with the...

1407
01:49:56.911 --> 01:49:58.684
It's time.

1408
01:49:59.406 --> 01:50:01.310
wind effect.

1409
01:50:02.127 --> 01:50:05.086
You know,
there's a lot-a lot variables...

1410
01:50:05.328 --> 01:50:07.136
in the street.

1411
01:50:10.569 --> 01:50:12.418
I gotta go.

1412
01:50:12.836 --> 01:50:15.051
Are you coming back?

1413
01:50:15.714 --> 01:50:16.860
Yeah.

1414
01:50:16.885 --> 01:50:19.515
I'm working it out.
All right?

1415
01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:24.616
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go without...

1416
01:50:24.641 --> 01:50:26.485
without killing them all.

1417
01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:28.114
Bring in it.

1418
01:50:30.741 --> 01:50:32.853
I love you, Daddy.

1419
01:50:34.974 --> 01:50:36.681
I love you.

1420
01:51:02.042 --> 01:51:04.731
Hey!
Let me out!

1421
01:51:04.732 --> 01:51:06.686
Let me out of here right now!

1422
01:51:06.711 --> 01:51:10.470
Hey!
You feel that? Yeah.

1423
01:51:10.495 --> 01:51:13.904
Let me out of here, darling, please.
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1424
01:51:13.929 --> 01:51:17.474
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1425
01:51:17.499 --> 01:51:19.275
Come on!

1426
01:52:04.404 --> 01:52:06.950
JOKER

1427
01:52:14.001 --> 01:52:15.522
Puddin'!

1428
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:20.102
Let's go home.

1429
01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:46.395
This is crown jewels here, Mr. Wayne.

1430
01:54:47.399 --> 01:54:49.408
And you do understand
my legal exposure.

1431
01:54:49.433 --> 01:54:51.589
If anyone knew what
I've procured for you...

1432
01:54:51.614 --> 01:54:56.288
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?
What do you want?

1433
01:54:56.313 --> 01:54:59.056
People are asking questions
about MidWay City.

1434
01:54:59.081 --> 01:55:00.728
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1435
01:55:00.753 --> 01:55:04.298
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

1436
01:55:04.323 --> 01:55:08.788
Consider yourself under my protection,
if you deliver.

1437
01:55:18.968 --> 01:55:20.345
MOONE, JUNE

1438
01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:22.248
ALLEN, BARRY

1439
01:55:22.273 --> 01:55:23.383
CURRY, ARTHUR

1440
01:55:24.481 --> 01:55:26.573
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1441
01:55:28.289 --> 01:55:30.442
I just like to make friends.

1442
01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:32.913
That's the difference between us

1443
01:55:32.938 --> 01:55:33.815
You believe in friendship.

1444
01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.971
I believe in leverage.

1445
01:55:36.336 --> 01:55:37.536
Goodnight.

1446
01:55:37.561 --> 01:55:39.363
You look tired.

1447
01:55:39.495 --> 01:55:42.182
You should stop working nights.

1448
01:55:42.869 --> 01:55:45.112
You should shut it down,

1449
01:55:45.113 --> 01:55:47.619
or my friends and I
will do it for you.
