1
00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.864
Thank you.

2
00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.671
- How long do you stay in Berlin?
- Three weeks.

3
00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:27.666
- How much money do you have?
- Four pounds.

4
00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.520
- For three weeks?

5
00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:31.385
I'm staying with my brother and
his wife; he should be here somewhere.

6
00:03:31.437 --> 00:03:32.740
Thank you.

7
00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:47.094
- Susanne?
- Bettina.

8
00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:49.969
Hallo, Susanne. Welcome to Berlin.

9
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.791
- Martin was so sorry he couldn't get
here. - So wonderful to see you at last!

10
00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:56.083
He had to be on duty at the hospital.

11
00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.084
Come: get your luggage
and we'll start for home.

12
00:04:07.484 --> 00:04:09.522
They are refugees from the East.

13
00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.571
You don't speak any German at all?

14
00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:22.277
- What was that? - Nothing.
Money changer. East marks into West.

15
00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:50.833
- l never imagined it like this. - I
wanted to show you something nice first.

16
00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.586
They say first impressions last long.

17
00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.456
This is the Brandenburger Tor.

18
00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:02.837
It's the East-West frontier now.

19
00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:06.125
- If you cross over there you are
in the East. - The Russian sector?

20
00:05:06.217 --> 00:05:08.374
Don't expect it to be too exciting.

21
00:05:08.468 --> 00:05:12.249
Quite a lot happens every day, but you
only learn it from the newspapers.

22
00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:15.094
- This is near your home?
- Right here--there.

23
00:06:16.788 --> 00:06:21.780
Some people like nothing but to gossip
all day. This is new to me, this style.

24
00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:23.404
It's very attractive.

25
00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:27.081
You think so? I'm still not sure.
I shall leave it to Martin.

26
00:06:28.043 --> 00:06:30.711
So far it's been a week
and he hasn't even noticed it.

27
00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:35.121
- But where is he? Your brother works
too hard. - He always did.

28
00:06:35.212 --> 00:06:38.662
Don't look too closely. Some things
are old, others we have just bought.

29
00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:42.004
- Have you lived here for long?
- Yes, yes, since I was a child.

30
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.753
It's a lot to look after, though.
This is your room in there.

31
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:50.800
You know, you look much younger
than in your photographs.

32
00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:55.966
Ah, Martin promised to clear his clothes
away this morning before he left.

33
00:06:56.054 --> 00:06:58.840
- Won't he mind being turned out
of his room? - No, no, of course not.

34
00:07:09.727 --> 00:07:12.726
Before, we only had a view
of the houses opposite.

35
00:07:12.812 --> 00:07:16.428
That was all built up--all the way
to the East-West frontier.

36
00:07:17.397 --> 00:07:18.392
Over there.

37
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:20.721
- It's near, isn't it?
- Near enough.

38
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:21.893
Susanne...

39
00:07:24.025 --> 00:07:27.806
- Martin! - Darling, I'm sorry
I couldn't get to the airport.

40
00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:29.871
- l got held up at the last minute.
- Oh, that's alright, I managed--

41
00:07:29.923 --> 00:07:32.308
- The plane must have got in
right on time. - Yes, it did!

42
00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:34.644
How smart you look--and grown up, too!

43
00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:36.859
- Thank you for asking me.
- So you found Bettina alright?

44
00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:38.144
Well, we--we found each other.

45
00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:40.645
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

46
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.011
Did you have a good flight?

47
00:07:42.063 --> 00:07:44.570
Oh, it was alright.
I was too excited to pay much attention.

48
00:07:44.658 --> 00:07:46.982
- Did you leave everybody alright at
home? - Yes, they're fine; they all--

49
00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:49.045
Oh, by the way, I've managed
to get this evening off.

50
00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:50.140
We'll all go out somewhere.

51
00:07:50.786 --> 00:07:53.157
Isn't it wonderful that
she's here at last?

52
00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:55.153
Just the three of us together.

53
00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:19.146
- Oh, what a fool! Look what I've done!
- Here, darling, take this.

54
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.480
No, no, I'll ask the lady
in the cloak-room.

55
00:09:21.574 --> 00:09:24.573
I won't be a moment. Why don't you
dance with Susanne in the meantime?

56
00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:26.586
Are you going to insist on dancing?

57
00:09:26.638 --> 00:09:28.618
Not unless you're better
than you used to be.

58
00:09:46.074 --> 00:09:47.585
Do you like it in Berlin?

59
00:09:47.637 --> 00:09:49.461
If I hadn't come,
I shouldn't have met Bettina.

60
00:09:49.721 --> 00:09:51.284
She's lovely, Martin.

61
00:09:59.882 --> 00:10:01.914
Bettina says you work too hard.

62
00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:04.258
Well, the last few weeks
have been a bit of a rush.

63
00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:06.864
The army have lent me to help out at
a refugee camp.

64
00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:10.042
There are one or two cases of typhoid
among the refugees.

65
00:10:10.094 --> 00:10:12.908
I'm afraid I shall be glad when I can
get back to England and practice again.

66
00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:17.076
We passed the Eastern sector today.
We didn't go in, of course--just drove.

67
00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:20.515
- You can go in, you know.
- Really? I must before I go home.

68
00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:22.162
I wouldn't go wondering in alone.

69
00:10:24.017 --> 00:10:25.622
Oh, Susanne wants to see
the Eastern sector.

70
00:10:25.674 --> 00:10:26.924
You'll take her across,
won't you, darling?

71
00:10:26.976 --> 00:10:29.060
Of course, if she wants to see it.

72
00:10:29.113 --> 00:10:31.353
But Martin, I have the most
terrible headache.

73
00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:32.968
You don't mind if I leave you
and go home?

74
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.740
- Darling, I am sorry.
- Oh, it will be alright.

75
00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:35.808
Shall we all go?

76
00:10:35.897 --> 00:10:37.866
Oh, no, it's Susanne's
first night in Berlin...

77
00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:39.429
and you've only seen part of the show.

78
00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:41.774
- Bettina, I don't mind.
- No, of course she doesn't. Herr Ober!

79
00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:43.598
She's probably tired
after the journey, anyway.

80
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.682
I'll take a cab and you can stay!

81
00:10:45.734 --> 00:10:48.392
Martin works so hard;
he hardly ever has an evening off.

82
00:10:48.444 --> 00:10:50.945
Nonsense, darling!
We'd much rather go, really.

83
00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:54.858
Really, we needn't all go.

84
00:11:15.205 --> 00:11:16.828
Susanne.

85
00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:32.286
- Would you like to walk for a bit?
- No, thank you, it's better already.

86
00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:37.037
I think nightclub air must be the same
all over the world.

87
00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:40.628
They probably bottle it and ship it from
country to country.

88
00:11:59.057 --> 00:12:01.546
What was that, a race or a chase?

89
00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:03.679
No, more like a chase.

90
00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:05.889
It looks as if they're heading for
the Tiergartenstrasse.

91
00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:09.094
They'll be there in a moment;
then over the frontier, poor devil.

92
00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:11.592
They've picked up someone over here
who's wanted in the East.

93
00:12:11.687 --> 00:12:14.556
Oh, Martin, Martin, please!

94
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.305
You don't know what happened.
How do you know that?

95
00:12:17.398 --> 00:12:20.774
Sorry, darling, I was just telling
Susanne that sometimes people--

96
00:12:20.826 --> 00:12:22.910
Alright, alright! Don't go on.

97
00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.269
I'll go and get the car.

98
00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:31.566
Things like that don't happen everyday.

99
00:12:32.112 --> 00:12:35.977
You'll be bored with Berlin
before you leave. You'll see.

100
00:13:20.507 --> 00:13:22.084
Oh, it's you, Bettina.

101
00:13:23.217 --> 00:13:24.212
Susanne.

102
00:13:26.218 --> 00:13:27.249
What are you doing?

103
00:13:27.344 --> 00:13:29.880
I heard a sort of noise... outside.

104
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.565
Nonsense! You are tired.
Probably over-tired.

105
00:13:33.617 --> 00:13:35.180
I thought I heard something.

106
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:37.733
Of course, I should have
told you about it.

107
00:13:37.785 --> 00:13:41.433
It's the owl on the ruins of the
Italian Embassy across the street.

108
00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:43.638
- The sound came from the street,
didn't it? - Mhm-hm.

109
00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:46.429
Aren't you cold, dear?
I shall get you another blanket.

110
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:06.892
I'm sorry you were disturbed.

111
00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:09.024
- Shall I close the window?
- No, I like it open.

112
00:14:10.112 --> 00:14:14.107
I couldn't sleep, and then I started
to worry about the front door.

113
00:14:14.197 --> 00:14:16.069
I didn't want to disturb Martin.

114
00:14:16.698 --> 00:14:19.234
Now get some sleep.
You mustn't be tired tomorrow.

115
00:14:21.408 --> 00:14:24.407
You wanted to see the
Eastern sector... remember?

116
00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:26.992
- Good night.
- Good night.

117
00:15:02.258 --> 00:15:03.811
What are they looking for?

118
00:15:03.863 --> 00:15:06.781
Newspapers, books...
any sort of propaganda.

119
00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:08.292
Also, the Eastern mark is cheaper...

120
00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:11.471
so people try to buy food here
and smuggle it across.

121
00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.768
Tell me, if it's so easy
for them to get across...

122
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.488
why don't they go?
I mean, it would seem that it's--

123
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.946
They have homes here--or families, and--

124
00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:21.828
Ivo, Ivo...

125
00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:28.524
- Would you like to move on?
- Yes. - Herr Ober!

126
00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:11.219
My sister-in-law, Miss Mallison,
Mr. Ivo Kern.

127
00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:13.884
So this is the long-expected
visitor from London.

128
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.307
How kind of Bettina to brighten our dull
Eatern sector by bringing you here.

129
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:20.379
I'm delighted to see, Bettina...

130
00:17:20.431 --> 00:17:23.297
that even your principles
are subject to revision and change.

131
00:17:23.557 --> 00:17:27.986
- Susanne wanted to see the sector.
- Ah, then your views have not changed?

132
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:33.561
We--Bettina and I--do not see eye-to-eye
about some things:

133
00:17:33.614 --> 00:17:35.281
this part of Berlin, for instance.

134
00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:39.658
But we are old friends, and it is our
privilege to quarrel over little things.

135
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.481
Little things like war and peace...

136
00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:43.930
the division of our country,
the fate of the world.

137
00:17:43.993 --> 00:17:48.403
- Trifles! ... You speak German?
- No, I'm sorry.

138
00:17:48.495 --> 00:17:50.579
The German always
had to learn languages:

139
00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:52.788
the army never knew
where it would be going.

140
00:17:52.872 --> 00:17:55.289
We still learn English in our schools...

141
00:17:55.341 --> 00:17:57.426
but it might be rather a waste,
who knows?

142
00:17:58.624 --> 00:18:00.615
What do you think?

143
00:18:04.085 --> 00:18:06.455
- Is this your first visit to Berlin?
- Yes.

144
00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:10.788
- You find it amusing?
- It's sad to see all this destruction.

145
00:18:10.879 --> 00:18:12.337
There isn't much else.

146
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:14.568
The ruins are now
a familiar part of the city:

147
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.528
the Berliner no longer notices them--
doesn't even see them--isn't that right?

148
00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.863
You are a Berliner still,
if no longer in name.

149
00:18:22.592 --> 00:18:26.718
I suppose so. It's a subject
I don't think about very much.

150
00:18:27.803 --> 00:18:29.344
How is your husband?

151
00:18:29.429 --> 00:18:31.503
Fine, he works as usual.

152
00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:34.629
Your brother is a very
exceptional person:

153
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:36.557
a military man who is also an idealist.

154
00:18:36.609 --> 00:18:38.637
He works too hard.
We're going to try to stop him.

155
00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:41.676
- Admirable. Very sisterly.
- I think we have to go.

156
00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:44.007
Martin will be back.

157
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:47.054
- I have Eastern marks.
- No, let me pay.

158
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.100
They don't often buy anything
so pleasant as a meeting like this.

159
00:18:52.855 --> 00:18:55.143
What a pity that one ever has
to come out-of-doors.

160
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:59.013
Inside, with the curtains closed,
it's possible to forget the present,

161
00:18:59.108 --> 00:19:02.505
turn your back to the future and face
the past with hope and confidence.

162
00:19:02.557 --> 00:19:05.683
Well, we'll be going this way
to the frontier. Goodbye.

163
00:19:06.194 --> 00:19:07.757
Goodbye, Bettina.

164
00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:10.217
Miss Mallison, it's refreshing
to speak English again.

165
00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:11.363
If ever you need a guide--

166
00:19:11.415 --> 00:19:14.698
one thoroughly familiar with Berlin
in all its glory--please call on me.

167
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.063
- You have my number, I think?
- Yes, I think so.

168
00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.195
I look forward to hearing from you.

169
00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:34.821
You know how it is in large cities:
people don't meet for a long time and...

170
00:19:34.914 --> 00:19:38.780
then quite suddenly run into each
other several times. - Yes, of course.

171
00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:43.912
- What does he do?
- I don't really know nowadays. He had--

172
00:19:44.002 --> 00:19:45.127
We are coming to the frontier.

173
00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:47.107
I think it's better if we don't
speak English now.

174
00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.779
Did all these come over from
the East during the weekend?

175
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:00.394
Yes, just under 3,000.

176
00:20:00.508 --> 00:20:02.547
About twice as many
as we've got accomodation for.

177
00:20:03.426 --> 00:20:08.714
He is waiting for food papers, medical
papers, job papers, Police papers...

178
00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:12.218
all papers; and then... you start again.

179
00:20:12.305 --> 00:20:13.680
Please in here.

180
00:20:14.723 --> 00:20:17.722
- Martin.
- Susanne, what are you doing here?

181
00:20:17.807 --> 00:20:19.516
Bettina asked me to bring you these.

182
00:20:19.569 --> 00:20:22.070
Razor blades? How sweet of her,
but really we've got everything here.

183
00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:23.320
- Sorry.
- Of course.

184
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.479
Yes, alright, I'll wait.

185
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.933
We missed you last night--
we hoped you might manage to get home.

186
00:20:31.136 --> 00:20:33.220
Went into the Eastern sector yesterday--

187
00:20:33.314 --> 00:20:35.803
went into a restaurant
and met a friend of Bettina's.

188
00:20:35.898 --> 00:20:38.732
- Oh, who was it?
- A man named Ivo Kern.

189
00:20:38.816 --> 00:20:40.891
Oh yes, I know:
he's an old friend of Bettina's.

190
00:20:40.984 --> 00:20:43.068
Martin, are you always as busy as this?

191
00:20:43.818 --> 00:20:46.604
It must be so difficult for her.
I wouldn't know how to fill up my days.

192
00:20:46.695 --> 00:20:49.560
Oh, she's alright. She's a Berliner.
She has her friends here.

193
00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:52.105
You don't think you leave
her alone too much?

194
00:20:52.197 --> 00:20:55.279
Perhaps one day people will decide to
fall ill between the hours of 9 and 5.

195
00:20:55.365 --> 00:20:57.072
Things will ease up a bit
in a day or two.

196
00:20:57.157 --> 00:20:58.188
Hello, yes, speaking.

197
00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:01.155
Yes, I wanted to ask you about that.

198
00:21:01.868 --> 00:21:03.824
No, the intake--that's not the point.

199
00:21:30.004 --> 00:21:34.296
- Susanne. - Ah, there you are!
I have been waiting patiently.

200
00:21:34.381 --> 00:21:37.878
- For me? - To offer my services
as a guide--if you are free tonight?

201
00:21:37.966 --> 00:21:39.915
How is Martin? Did you see him?

202
00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:43.093
He may have to stay there tonight--
he said he'd phone you.

203
00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:46.259
If you'll excuse me,
I'll put away my things.

204
00:22:06.144 --> 00:22:09.642
- Were you serious about asking me
to go out with you tonight? - Of course.

205
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:11.139
What time shall I call for you?

206
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.138
But if Martin doesn't get back,
Bettina...

207
00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.772
do you mind if I--?
- No, only we had--

208
00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:18.473
Of course Bettina wouldn't mind.
I can never get Bettina to go anywhere.

209
00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:20.849
I call for you at seven.
Seven o'clock, huh?

210
00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:22.603
Alright. Thank you.

211
00:22:26.236 --> 00:22:27.398
Goodbye, Bettina.

212
00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:29.566
Goodbye, Ivo.

213
00:22:32.489 --> 00:22:34.052
Then I shall see you later, Susanne.

214
00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:36.970
I think you are about young enough
for me to call you Susanne, don't you?

215
00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:27.504
- You dance quite well.
- Thank you.

216
00:23:29.721 --> 00:23:31.760
Have you known Bettina for a long time?

217
00:23:33.973 --> 00:23:36.011
Yes, quite a long time.

218
00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:39.053
Does she speak well of me?

219
00:23:39.142 --> 00:23:42.722
- Not that I heard. Why, did you
think she would? - No, not really.

220
00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:54.294
This is another boring
feature of the place:

221
00:23:54.346 --> 00:23:57.264
people keep telephoning your table
if they take a fancy to you.

222
00:23:57.316 --> 00:23:58.940
I take no notice of it.

223
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:05.757
- I must seem very rude to you,
asking so many questions. - Not at all.

224
00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:08.988
- Only it's all so strange to me--this
place, these people... - Go on asking!

225
00:24:09.071 --> 00:24:10.778
I don't know what--

226
00:24:10.863 --> 00:24:12.902
Well, tell me something about yourself.

227
00:24:15.115 --> 00:24:19.200
- Perhaps you have an admirer. Would you
like to listen? - No, no, please, no!

228
00:24:19.252 --> 00:24:21.024
Alright, I will.

229
00:24:40.084 --> 00:24:42.704
Crazy people. What were you saying?

230
00:24:43.252 --> 00:24:45.457
I don't know. I was just saying:
tell me about you, your work--

231
00:24:45.545 --> 00:24:47.441
Alright. Which story would
you like to here?

232
00:24:47.493 --> 00:24:49.526
The one about my property
in East Prussia,

233
00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:52.256
for which I'm soon to receive
a huge compensation?

234
00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:55.457
Or the story of my lost
collection of paintings,

235
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:57.540
for which I'm suing
the French government?

236
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.172
Or about my great deeds
of valour in the war,

237
00:25:00.259 --> 00:25:04.669
which I've already told so many people
that I almost believe it myself.

238
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:08.839
Or--in your honour--would you like me to
invent something entirely new?

239
00:25:10.305 --> 00:25:12.047
In my honour, why not tell the truth?

240
00:25:14.807 --> 00:25:17.379
The truth passed me by a long time ago.

241
00:25:17.475 --> 00:25:19.382
Then I'll have to go on
asking you questions.

242
00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:20.893
What did you do before the war?

243
00:25:24.228 --> 00:25:25.999
Miss Mallison, Mr. Halendar.

244
00:25:26.062 --> 00:25:27.057
How do you do?

245
00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:33.138
So Miss Mallison,
you are new in Berlin, yes?

246
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.679
Yes, I'm staying with my brother:
he's stationed here.

247
00:25:35.774 --> 00:25:38.773
- You speak German, Miss Mallison?
- I'm sorry, not at all.

248
00:25:50.655 --> 00:25:52.312
We shouldn't keep you from your friends.

249
00:25:52.364 --> 00:25:55.491
Besides, we must go:
Miss Mallison has to go home early.

250
00:25:55.574 --> 00:25:58.324
Oh, no, I'm quite alright.
Bettina's given me the key, and--

251
00:25:58.409 --> 00:26:02.819
- How is Bettina? - Oh, she's very...
Do you know her well?

252
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.443
I met her with Ivo.
Have you seen her lately?

253
00:26:08.371 --> 00:26:09.366
No.

254
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.497
You must get Ivo to take you
to the Opera in the Eastern sector.

255
00:26:13.582 --> 00:26:14.822
It is better than the West.

256
00:26:14.874 --> 00:26:17.635
Let me send you tickets.
I have some influence at the theatre.

257
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:20.826
- That's very kind of you. Thank you
so much. - Good. What address?

258
00:26:20.918 --> 00:26:22.956
- 8 Bernhardstrasse.
- Thank you.

259
00:26:25.086 --> 00:26:26.233
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

260
00:26:39.009 --> 00:26:42.293
Is that what you do in London--
give your address to strangers?

261
00:26:42.385 --> 00:26:45.752
But I thought he was a friend of yours.
- I've met him a few times.

262
00:26:45.845 --> 00:26:50.014
It was very nice of him. Anyway, I can't
take up all of Bettina's time, can I?

263
00:26:50.764 --> 00:26:52.672
So we're back to that again, are we?

264
00:26:52.765 --> 00:26:56.712
- Why get angry just because I mention
Bettina? - Guilty conscience, no doubt.

265
00:26:56.808 --> 00:26:59.684
Do you have in mind continuing
to investigate me through him?

266
00:26:59.736 --> 00:27:02.290
Don't you want to go on questioning me?

267
00:27:02.852 --> 00:27:04.891
Why don't you leave her alone?

268
00:27:06.312 --> 00:27:08.980
Don't tell me it's none of my business:
Bettina's married to my brother.

269
00:27:09.063 --> 00:27:11.616
Your sisterly concern does you credit,
my dear Susanne.

270
00:27:11.668 --> 00:27:15.316
When you are a little older, if you are
still interested I'll explain it all.

271
00:27:15.524 --> 00:27:19.693
Excuse me, I have some business.
You won't mind if I send you home alone?

272
00:27:20.318 --> 00:27:22.724
- No, not at all.
- Goodnight.

273
00:27:56.833 --> 00:28:00.876
Miss Mallison... Mr. lvo Kern, he wishes
that you should meet him.

274
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.327
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Please, listen, wait!

275
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.285
Wait! Important, he say...
about Madame Bettina.

276
00:28:09.672 --> 00:28:13.169
- Alright. Where is he?
- I will show you, yes? Please, come!

277
00:28:14.591 --> 00:28:15.586
Come, come.

278
00:28:33.182 --> 00:28:37.343
- If an apology about last night is
of any use... - I didn't come for that.

279
00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:46.520
I've been thinking all night...
about Bettina.

280
00:28:47.229 --> 00:28:50.063
About myself--about what you said.

281
00:28:51.898 --> 00:28:57.109
You were quite right, of course.
I suppose that's what made me so angry.

282
00:28:59.443 --> 00:29:04.351
- I do hate interfering. - I think it
made me see things rather more clearly.

283
00:29:04.445 --> 00:29:08.772
Bettina and I--well, it's one of those
things you drift into.

284
00:29:08.863 --> 00:29:11.614
I didn't ever mean to start
anything serious.

285
00:29:12.615 --> 00:29:15.741
Bettina and I had known each other
for a long time.

286
00:29:16.033 --> 00:29:18.523
We met here again in Berlin.

287
00:29:19.326 --> 00:29:22.029
At first, I didn't even know
she was married.

288
00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:23.743
I'm glad you told me.

289
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.494
- Mind you, there was never anything...
You know. - No, no, of course.

290
00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:30.529
But it was my fault.

291
00:29:30.581 --> 00:29:33.327
I didn't think Bettina would
take it all so much to heart.

292
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:39.491
I'm making arrangements as quickly as I
can to get away from Berlin altogether.

293
00:29:39.543 --> 00:29:41.106
That'll be the end of it.

294
00:29:42.252 --> 00:29:43.414
Does that make you happy?

295
00:29:44.337 --> 00:29:48.166
- Yes, it does.
- I am happy now that I've told you.

296
00:29:48.255 --> 00:29:50.579
Come, I'll see you home.

297
00:29:51.673 --> 00:29:55.715
- I'd like to tell you that--
- It's not necessary. It's finished.

298
00:29:58.217 --> 00:30:04.252
- l only wanted to say thank you.
- Don't look so sad! Reward me! Smile!

299
00:30:12.515 --> 00:30:14.092
Be down in a moment.

300
00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:19.015
- Too tight?
- No, no, thank you.

301
00:30:19.101 --> 00:30:21.019
You keep on with these tricks
in the Eastern sector...

302
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:22.582
they're bound to catch you.

303
00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:24.145
Then it'll be your head, not your hand.

304
00:30:26.354 --> 00:30:28.470
You're becoming over-confident.

305
00:30:28.522 --> 00:30:31.596
You should give it up...
before you get into more trouble.

306
00:30:31.648 --> 00:30:33.420
You're getting too old
for this kind of work.

307
00:30:33.472 --> 00:30:35.243
It's always the old dogs that are best.

308
00:30:35.316 --> 00:30:38.102
- It was an old dog that bit me.
- It's too dangerous for you.

309
00:30:38.193 --> 00:30:41.476
They have no suspicion who I am.
They don't connect me with Kastner.

310
00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:43.228
What were you doing this time?

311
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.883
They had some documents
in the Eastern sector...

312
00:30:44.935 --> 00:30:47.176
which were of interest to us
in the West. That was all.

313
00:30:47.238 --> 00:30:51.529
- Bettina? - Susanne, I want you to meet
a great friend of ours--Olaf Kastner.

314
00:30:52.782 --> 00:30:54.240
- Kastner.
- You cut yourself?

315
00:30:54.324 --> 00:30:56.659
- A dog bit him. - This one happened not
to be man's best friend.

316
00:30:57.701 --> 00:30:58.951
I'll get lunch ready.

317
00:30:59.003 --> 00:31:01.713
Oh, do you mind not for me?
I'm going skating with Ivo.

318
00:31:01.786 --> 00:31:04.162
lvo? Oh, Ivo Kern.
That's your friend isn't it, Bettina?

319
00:31:04.214 --> 00:31:06.402
Yes, yes, someone I knew here years ago.

320
00:31:07.163 --> 00:31:09.768
He seems to have taken
quite a fancy to Susanne.

321
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.655
l can't for the life of me think why.

322
00:31:13.166 --> 00:31:16.615
- Oh, Bettina, will you lend me your
skates again? - Yes, of course.

323
00:31:29.131 --> 00:31:32.794
Susanne, you are going out
with Ivo again?

324
00:31:33.924 --> 00:31:36.959
- Don't you think I should?
- It's not important.

325
00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:41.676
Only you mustn't get too fond of Berlin.
It's a long way from London.

326
00:31:43.428 --> 00:31:45.135
Only five hours by plane.

327
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.127
Susanne, I've known Ivo a long time ago.

328
00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:54.495
I don't know much about
what he has become, or...

329
00:31:54.756 --> 00:31:57.882
if he is the kind of person
you should be with a great deal.

330
00:31:58.893 --> 00:32:02.094
He's always very correct with me
if that's what you mean.

331
00:32:06.313 --> 00:32:10.143
There isn't a great difference
between our ages, Susanne,

332
00:32:10.231 --> 00:32:13.598
but there's a hundred years
between the way we've lived.

333
00:32:14.941 --> 00:32:17.645
Why doesn't Martin mind
my going out with Ivo?

334
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.726
I'll get you the skates.

335
00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:31.103
- Let me know if it gives you
any trouble. - Goodbye.

336
00:32:31.198 --> 00:32:35.194
- Bye, Miss Mallison.
- Goodbye, Olaf.

337
00:32:35.283 --> 00:32:38.781
You'll never catch him on skates,
Susanne. Tell him you're an heiress.

338
00:32:46.997 --> 00:32:50.031
- Goodbye, Miss Mallison.
- Oh, do you know Mr. Ivo Kern?

339
00:32:50.123 --> 00:32:52.743
Excuse my hand: I had an accident.

340
00:32:53.708 --> 00:32:57.075
- Bad? - No, no, nothing.
Just playing with a dog.

341
00:32:57.168 --> 00:32:58.533
Can we give you a lift?

342
00:32:58.585 --> 00:33:01.346
Thank you so much, Miss Mallison:
only going around the corner.

343
00:33:01.419 --> 00:33:02.699
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

344
00:33:39.602 --> 00:33:43.549
Oh... Excuse me--it's Halendar.

345
00:33:55.692 --> 00:33:58.608
While you are skating and waltzing
my office is in an uproar.

346
00:33:58.693 --> 00:34:00.850
The business with Kastner
must be finished.

347
00:34:00.944 --> 00:34:04.856
- Kastner again? What's happened now?
- This morning he appeared in the East

348
00:34:04.946 --> 00:34:08.510
...in the unform of one of our
own Generals with a staff car...

349
00:34:08.562 --> 00:34:11.324
and helped two of our Police officers
to escape into the West...

350
00:34:11.376 --> 00:34:15.148
with a van-load of records and documents
--the most damaging kind of things.

351
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.991
- Are you sure it was Kastner?
- Who else?

352
00:34:17.076 --> 00:34:20.739
Besides, there was a row at the
frontier. Nobody could identify him...

353
00:34:20.828 --> 00:34:23.204
but I'm told one of the dogs
got him by the hand.

354
00:34:23.256 --> 00:34:24.767
He fought loose and got away.

355
00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:27.164
What's more, the dog went
after him and didn't come back.

356
00:34:27.216 --> 00:34:29.717
The dog knows which side
has the best food.

357
00:34:29.769 --> 00:34:32.530
Yes, yes, yes, I can see
how it amuses you.

358
00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:36.329
Kastner comes and goes, taking our
people from right under our noses...

359
00:34:36.417 --> 00:34:40.247
and for all our efforts we still
don't even know what he looks like.

360
00:34:40.336 --> 00:34:42.535
You say one of the dogs got Kastner?

361
00:34:42.587 --> 00:34:45.661
Yes, yes, yes, I told you:
by the hand, but he got away.

362
00:34:46.755 --> 00:34:50.537
Yes, so he did.
Well, perhaps his luck will break.

363
00:34:50.632 --> 00:34:53.121
How is it you favour Miss Bettina
and now with this girl?

364
00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:56.050
Has your heart been touched?
That could be dangerous!

365
00:34:56.134 --> 00:34:59.252
You have the contacts.
Kastner is a friend of that family.

366
00:34:59.344 --> 00:35:03.090
If not the wife, then the sister.
But somehow, Ivo, it must be done.

367
00:35:03.179 --> 00:35:05.087
Would you like me to drop it altogether?

368
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.424
That would be most unwise, Ivo,
most unwise.

369
00:35:11.641 --> 00:35:14.924
What's the manuscript?
Is that the story of your life?

370
00:35:15.017 --> 00:35:19.760
Not mine: yours. I was hoping you
wouldn't make it necessary, Ivo, but--

371
00:35:19.852 --> 00:35:22.760
"The post-war activities of Ivo Kern...

372
00:35:22.812 --> 00:35:25.886
in the British and American
zones of Germany."

373
00:35:25.938 --> 00:35:30.313
It's quite a long report: your work with
forged and stolen passports in Munich;

374
00:35:30.732 --> 00:35:33.138
the diversion and sale
of American petrol;

375
00:35:33.233 --> 00:35:35.901
illegal firearms business in Dusseldorf;

376
00:35:35.984 --> 00:35:38.272
the American Major's wife, etc., etc.

377
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.312
Please, you'll spoil it for me.
I want to read it myself.

378
00:35:41.403 --> 00:35:43.967
You have until the end
of the week for this.

379
00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:46.780
Either you succeed or this goes
to the Russian police.

380
00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:51.261
Of course, it only means that you can
never again set foot in the West;

381
00:35:51.313 --> 00:35:53.898
that you'll remain permanently
with us in the East.

382
00:35:53.992 --> 00:35:58.532
Permanently in the East with you.
Enchanting.

383
00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:01.943
For you to arrange this meeting
has been quite expensive.

384
00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:05.642
Do you suppose they don't ask me
to account for the money I spend?

385
00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:06.944
Wait here for a while.

386
00:36:08.498 --> 00:36:10.121
You are going to get a bargain.

387
00:36:17.168 --> 00:36:20.701
You know that fellow we met
outside your house today?

388
00:36:27.297 --> 00:36:30.296
When you leave, why not take the boy?
Give him a chance.

389
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.254
It's difficult enough to get myself out.

390
00:36:35.342 --> 00:36:38.295
I have everything I need.
All but one thing:

391
00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:41.053
a guarantee of an employ
in the Western zone.

392
00:36:45.888 --> 00:36:46.884
What is it?

393
00:36:47.681 --> 00:36:51.379
- If only I'd thought of it
this morning. - Well, what?

394
00:36:51.474 --> 00:36:55.719
That fellow we met--your brother's
friend--the one with the injured hand.

395
00:36:55.809 --> 00:36:59.011
- Didn't you say his name was Kastner?
- Kastner, yes.

396
00:36:59.102 --> 00:37:04.390
I thought I recognised him! Now he's a
man with a lot of influence in the West.

397
00:37:05.897 --> 00:37:07.770
Ah, well, it doesn't matter.

398
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.392
But how could he help you, Ivo?

399
00:37:11.483 --> 00:37:15.411
For him it will be quite easy: he has
business contact, official contact...

400
00:37:15.463 --> 00:37:17.704
contact with all the people who matter.

401
00:37:19.236 --> 00:37:22.021
But don't you worry:
this is my problem.

402
00:37:22.112 --> 00:37:24.009
- But this man is a great
friend of Martin's. - Please!

403
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:27.031
Why shouldn't he arrange
for you to meet him?

404
00:37:33.408 --> 00:37:36.112
- She's not back yet?
- No, no she isn't.

405
00:37:36.201 --> 00:37:37.695
I wouldn't worry.

406
00:37:48.706 --> 00:37:52.204
- l'll talk to Martin now.
- Oh, forget that! We were just talking.

407
00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:56.290
- We weren't. We were planning.
- I shall think of something.

408
00:37:56.376 --> 00:38:00.372
Don't be silly.
I wouldn't mind asking a favour of you.

409
00:38:00.461 --> 00:38:02.025
l wish you would.

410
00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:05.224
If this works out alright,
you'll be leaving soon, won't you?

411
00:38:06.881 --> 00:38:11.587
Susanne, I think I should leave
as quickly as possible.

412
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.420
- Don't you?
- I don't know.

413
00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:17.885
Well, we'll let the Fates decide, huh?

414
00:38:18.677 --> 00:38:22.210
I'll call you as soon as Martin
makes the appointment.

415
00:38:22.304 --> 00:38:24.924
There never was such a persistent girl!

416
00:38:26.597 --> 00:38:28.755
- Goodnight, lvo.
- Goodnight.

417
00:38:38.227 --> 00:38:39.258
Is that you, Susanne?

418
00:38:39.353 --> 00:38:41.309
- Hello, Martin.
- Have a good time?

419
00:38:41.395 --> 00:38:42.509
Wonderful, thank you.

420
00:38:50.274 --> 00:38:52.645
- Martin, you like Ivo, don't you?
- Yes, he's alright.

421
00:38:52.733 --> 00:38:54.932
He wants to get out of the
Eastern sector. In fact...

422
00:38:54.984 --> 00:38:57.954
he wants to get out of Berlin
altogether and work in the West.

423
00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:01.108
And we met Mr. Kastner
coming out of the house.

424
00:39:02.237 --> 00:39:04.525
He said he was the very person
who could help him with...

425
00:39:04.613 --> 00:39:08.027
letters of introduction...
guarantees and so on.

426
00:39:08.615 --> 00:39:10.488
Yes, I dare say he could.

427
00:39:10.574 --> 00:39:12.648
Could you ask him over
to the house so that...

428
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.628
Ivo could meet him and talk about it?

429
00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:16.408
I don't see why not.

430
00:39:16.785 --> 00:39:18.901
Martin, you wouldn't phone him now,
would you?

431
00:39:18.953 --> 00:39:20.255
Yes, sure, of course I will.

432
00:39:26.206 --> 00:39:27.664
I wouldn't do that.

433
00:39:28.498 --> 00:39:29.494
No.

434
00:39:30.124 --> 00:39:31.997
He won't mind. I can try at any rate.

435
00:39:32.917 --> 00:39:33.912
No!

436
00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:37.000
Ivo wants to get out of Berlin
and Mr. Kastner can help him.

437
00:39:37.585 --> 00:39:40.524
Let Ivo look after himself:
he's had plenty of practice.

438
00:39:40.576 --> 00:39:42.608
You had no right to make
any such promise!

439
00:39:43.546 --> 00:39:46.360
- I'm sorry. - Well, it really doesn't
matter all that much. If Ivo wants--

440
00:39:46.422 --> 00:39:48.663
I say you mustn't telephone!
I won't have it!

441
00:39:48.757 --> 00:39:51.044
Darling, what is the matter
with you lately?

442
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.062
Oh, l expect I'm to blame.

443
00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:58.969
That's the first sensible word
you've said since you came here.

444
00:39:59.053 --> 00:40:00.585
And if you don't understand
what you've done...

445
00:40:00.637 --> 00:40:03.138
it's because you're incapable
of understanding anything.

446
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:06.304
- It was you who introduced me to Ivo.
- Yes, and then what happens?

447
00:40:06.389 --> 00:40:09.922
He smiles at you; he says he will
take you skating; you jump with joy.

448
00:40:10.016 --> 00:40:13.383
You think, "He is a roué!
Where's my Paris hat?" and off you go.

449
00:40:13.476 --> 00:40:15.017
And what do you know about him?
Nothing.

450
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:18.764
- Except he's a friend of yours.
- Shall I tell you about Ivo?

451
00:40:18.853 --> 00:40:22.433
Your precious Ivo?
Your charming escort?

452
00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:24.429
- He's a kidnapper
- Really--!

453
00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:27.604
Yes: a kidnapper! He steals people.

454
00:40:30.107 --> 00:40:34.233
For weeks he has been tormenting me,
trying to force me to get Olaf here.

455
00:40:34.318 --> 00:40:37.898
He's been driving me mad with--
with pleas and threats.

456
00:40:37.986 --> 00:40:40.392
I've tried to warn you!
I've tried to tell you!

457
00:40:40.487 --> 00:40:42.277
But why didn't you tell me about this?

458
00:40:46.823 --> 00:40:49.573
I know what you suspected.
I know what you thought of me.

459
00:40:49.657 --> 00:40:53.190
I want you to hear this...
You knew I was married before.

460
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.609
Martin, it was lvo I was married to.

461
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:01.866
Ivo?

462
00:41:03.455 --> 00:41:05.612
And now I suppose
I'm still married to him.

463
00:41:08.207 --> 00:41:10.291
I hadn't seen Ivo since '43.

464
00:41:10.979 --> 00:41:13.897
He was reported missing in France
and then he was thought to be killed.

465
00:41:14.334 --> 00:41:18.246
Martin and I had his death certified
so that we could be married.

466
00:41:20.629 --> 00:41:25.916
Then, three weeks ago...
he appeared... from nowhere...

467
00:41:26.006 --> 00:41:30.297
from the ruins of Berlin...
with a new name.

468
00:41:30.383 --> 00:41:31.769
l wanted to tell you at once.

469
00:41:31.821 --> 00:41:33.801
You can't have been afraid
to come and tell me?

470
00:41:33.884 --> 00:41:37.714
No, but--but he persuaded me
that it would harm you...

471
00:41:37.803 --> 00:41:39.845
that it would ruin your army career...

472
00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:42.794
if they found out that you were living
with a woman who is not your wife.

473
00:41:44.055 --> 00:41:49.295
The army would separate us. They
would send you away. I would lose you.

474
00:41:50.308 --> 00:41:55.382
Once he had planted the fear,
he started to talk about Olaf Kastner.

475
00:41:55.477 --> 00:41:58.844
He told me that he was
working for them in the East.

476
00:41:58.936 --> 00:42:03.263
He said I must get Kastner here.
I knew what that meant.

477
00:42:03.397 --> 00:42:08.607
They would leave together and Kastner
would be taken in the street.

478
00:42:08.857 --> 00:42:14.068
If I haven't been very sensible,
darling, it's--it's because I love you.

479
00:42:15.693 --> 00:42:20.020
And it's because I wanted
to protect you from all this dirt.

480
00:42:23.072 --> 00:42:25.177
Anyway, I thought we'd better
come and tell the Police...

481
00:42:25.229 --> 00:42:26.948
just what the position is.

482
00:42:27.032 --> 00:42:29.651
We are generally called in
only when it is too late.

483
00:42:29.741 --> 00:42:33.238
It is remarkable how few people
trust the Police in any country.

484
00:42:33.326 --> 00:42:36.379
And since lvo Kern is so
eager for a meeting...

485
00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:38.516
it would be a pity
to disappoint him, eh?

486
00:42:39.537 --> 00:42:42.986
The young lady will telephone;
she will say that it is all arranged;

487
00:42:43.497 --> 00:42:45.998
invite him to come for
a drink before lunch;

488
00:42:46.592 --> 00:42:48.311
I will personally shake the cocktails.

489
00:42:48.374 --> 00:42:49.832
How do you think they'll
try and get him?

490
00:42:49.916 --> 00:42:53.413
They will not make any attempt
in the house of a British officer.

491
00:42:53.501 --> 00:42:56.073
Anyway, they have no idea
what I look like.

492
00:42:56.752 --> 00:42:59.305
To identify me, they will
need your friend:

493
00:42:59.358 --> 00:43:00.869
the chap I met with you yesterday.

494
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:01.834
Ivo Kern?

495
00:43:01.921 --> 00:43:04.920
Yes, they will try and grab me
as I leave your house with him.

496
00:43:05.006 --> 00:43:08.040
And be perfectly casual,
just as always.

497
00:43:10.425 --> 00:43:12.463
Better do as he says, Susanne.

498
00:43:13.051 --> 00:43:16.252
Pity. He seems like a nice fellow.

499
00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:21.546
- Would you do it?
- It's no use asking me.

500
00:43:21.638 --> 00:43:24.637
He wouldn't listen to me.
I can't help you, Susanne.

501
00:43:26.015 --> 00:43:27.472
You must decide for yourself.

502
00:43:27.557 --> 00:43:32.797
Facts we deal in--not pretty pictures
of loyalty and sentiment, young lady.

503
00:43:33.434 --> 00:43:36.220
Our friend Kastner here has
many times risked his life...

504
00:43:36.311 --> 00:43:38.882
crossing to the East to rescue people
whose lives are in danger...

505
00:43:38.978 --> 00:43:41.511
and is all the time supplying
us with information...

506
00:43:41.563 --> 00:43:43.230
that is invaluable to the West.

507
00:43:43.314 --> 00:43:46.721
Since you've been used
in their trick to identify him...

508
00:43:46.773 --> 00:43:49.795
can you refuse to help us
at a moment like this?

509
00:43:49.858 --> 00:43:52.229
Remember: casual, ordinary.

510
00:44:01.988 --> 00:44:03.481
Take it. Please.

511
00:44:06.031 --> 00:44:07.406
Please!

512
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.197
Susanne, really!

513
00:44:18.578 --> 00:44:20.866
- Hello.
- Hello, lvo? Is that you?

514
00:44:20.954 --> 00:44:21.985
Hello? Yes.

515
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.489
I've spoken to Martin. He's asking Mr.
Kastner over for a drink before lunch.

516
00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:31.948
Would you like to come?

517
00:44:32.042 --> 00:44:35.741
Good. Fine. Yes, I'll be there.

518
00:45:12.184 --> 00:45:16.226
No sign of them in the neighbourhood.
My men have circled the entire area.

519
00:45:16.311 --> 00:45:17.801
I wish he had been punctual.

520
00:45:17.853 --> 00:45:20.615
I had an appointment for lunch
at 1 o'clock. It's nearly 2.

521
00:45:20.688 --> 00:45:23.094
They have been warned off somehow,
eh, Inspector?

522
00:45:23.189 --> 00:45:25.892
Those are your men--the labourers
clearing rubble across the street?

523
00:45:25.982 --> 00:45:29.349
They were working so hard, they knew
they couldn't be real labourers.

524
00:45:30.317 --> 00:45:33.482
Bettina, I'm sorry to be such
a bother: all this to-do.

525
00:45:56.453 --> 00:46:00.827
Did you speak to him?
Does he know anything more about us?

526
00:46:00.913 --> 00:46:04.539
It's pretty much as he said:
we're not married.

527
00:46:04.592 --> 00:46:06.415
It makes it all rather
romantic, doesn't it?

528
00:46:07.082 --> 00:46:10.947
- Please, not so near the window!
- He worries about me all the time.

529
00:46:11.042 --> 00:46:14.179
If he had his way, I would have
armed guards, Police protection...

530
00:46:14.231 --> 00:46:15.221
and a bullet-proof car.

531
00:46:15.294 --> 00:46:16.784
They've told me what you do.

532
00:46:16.836 --> 00:46:19.285
Oh, perhaps it's been exaggerated.
One just comes and goes.

533
00:46:19.337 --> 00:46:22.586
Ah, splendid! After all,
I was invited here to have a drink.

534
00:46:22.672 --> 00:46:25.873
- You'd like a whisky? Water or soda?
- Just water please.

535
00:46:25.965 --> 00:46:28.003
- Martin, how about you?
- Not for me, thanks.

536
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:32.915
He's not coming.

537
00:46:34.844 --> 00:46:36.919
What's that you say? Why?

538
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:39.296
He's not going to come.

539
00:46:40.429 --> 00:46:45.442
I know those marks down there: he has
a boy on a bicycle who spies for him.

540
00:46:45.494 --> 00:46:46.745
He's not going to come.

541
00:46:46.807 --> 00:46:49.089
Of course he spies for them.

542
00:46:49.141 --> 00:46:52.268
Where do you think a boy
like that gets a bicycle?

543
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.717
A new one. Out of pocket-money?

544
00:46:55.311 --> 00:46:58.061
Alright, he's fooled us this time.
But I'll still get him.

545
00:46:59.646 --> 00:47:03.428
Maybe it will be better
if you don't go out alone...

546
00:47:03.522 --> 00:47:05.597
the next two days. Be careful.

547
00:47:34.119 --> 00:47:37.182
What difference is it
going to make to us?

548
00:47:37.235 --> 00:47:39.840
Now that you know we are
not properly married?

549
00:47:41.122 --> 00:47:44.536
I'll have to take more care of you--
make sure I don't lose you.

550
00:47:45.582 --> 00:47:50.271
You could send me away if you want to.
You are free to do as you like.

551
00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:53.179
Somehow, they'll have to arrange
that we're not separated...

552
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:54.533
and get married again.

553
00:47:56.003 --> 00:48:00.171
You have to ask me first.
Come on, Martin.

554
00:48:01.047 --> 00:48:02.453
Will you, Bettina?

555
00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:07.127
I don't know.
I have to think about it.

556
00:48:10.426 --> 00:48:13.211
I thought I'd go over to BEA
to see about my return ticket.

557
00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:19.336
- I'm sorry, Susanne. - Stay a little
longer, won't you, Susanne?

558
00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:21.468
I'll come back again when I...

559
00:48:22.847 --> 00:48:24.222
Bye. I won't be long.

560
00:50:11.768 --> 00:50:16.807
The fools! I should like to come
with you and see you make your report.

561
00:50:16.895 --> 00:50:20.272
"Please, sir, I have kidnapped
the wrong woman."

562
00:50:20.324 --> 00:50:22.304
You will certainly get
promotion for this.

563
00:50:22.356 --> 00:50:26.102
You've made yourself famous at last:
another International Incident--

564
00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:28.597
the sister of a British Army officer!

565
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:32.106
What next? Perhaps the wife of the
French Ambassador to keep her company?

566
00:50:32.256 --> 00:50:33.715
Be quiet!

567
00:50:38.112 --> 00:50:39.655
It was a terrible mistake.

568
00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:43.771
A very reasonable explanation.
It could have happened to anyone.

569
00:50:43.823 --> 00:50:46.739
There was no need for it to happen
if you had done your job.

570
00:50:46.824 --> 00:50:51.484
So you thought that if you could
kidnap my wife--without my permission--

571
00:50:51.576 --> 00:50:55.572
you could intimidate her into helping
you to get Kastner. Was that it?

572
00:50:55.662 --> 00:50:57.371
I have had enough of your pleading...

573
00:50:57.423 --> 00:50:59.507
and debating the moral issues
with your wife.

574
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.113
I would have given her a few simple
orders and she would have obeyed.

575
00:51:03.206 --> 00:51:06.159
She is a German woman no matter
whom she has married since.

576
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.839
- Does he know anything yet?
- No, he knows nothing.

577
00:51:28.675 --> 00:51:29.671
Not yet.

578
00:52:06.525 --> 00:52:08.755
Such people, they say nothing.

579
00:52:08.807 --> 00:52:10.891
Have you made your confession
and been forgiven?

580
00:52:10.943 --> 00:52:13.184
I told him nothing and he said nothing.

581
00:52:13.236 --> 00:52:15.633
That must have been a very
interesting conversation.

582
00:52:16.529 --> 00:52:20.607
Let me clear up the mess you have made.
You will have to turn the girl loose.

583
00:52:20.697 --> 00:52:22.155
Let me take her back for you.

584
00:52:24.157 --> 00:52:26.195
I may still get Kastner.

585
00:52:27.075 --> 00:52:31.781
If I must turn the girl loose,
a few hours won't make any difference.

586
00:52:31.869 --> 00:52:33.659
Stay here a moment.

587
00:52:33.744 --> 00:52:37.443
What new and more brilliant blunder
are you meditating now?

588
00:52:37.538 --> 00:52:41.201
Another failure will hardly
make things worse for me.

589
00:52:41.289 --> 00:52:45.534
A little success on the other hand
may change the situation altogether.

590
00:52:47.792 --> 00:52:51.704
You're tired.
I'd get some sleep if I were you.

591
00:53:06.122 --> 00:53:07.321
Miss Mallison?

592
00:53:07.946 --> 00:53:10.030
Thank heaven I have found you!

593
00:53:12.719 --> 00:53:14.129
How do you feel?

594
00:53:15.178 --> 00:53:17.534
Well, I wasn't hurt,
but I'm not in a very good temper.

595
00:53:17.586 --> 00:53:19.566
I have just heard what happened.

596
00:53:19.639 --> 00:53:24.345
I want to help you if I can.
It was a mistake--such things happen.

597
00:53:24.432 --> 00:53:28.131
- What are you going to do? - Only
one thing: to get you out of here.

598
00:53:28.225 --> 00:53:32.517
Now I want to get you home, but I can't
take you through the frontier myself.

599
00:53:32.602 --> 00:53:35.139
Someone from the West must do that.

600
00:53:35.228 --> 00:53:39.520
Just write a note to your sister-in-law;
say you are in trouble,

601
00:53:39.605 --> 00:53:42.059
but a friend--a friend is helping you...

602
00:53:42.148 --> 00:53:46.688
and he will see that you will be outside
the Opera at the end of the performance,

603
00:53:47.442 --> 00:53:50.607
and ask her if someone
can come to fetch you.

604
00:53:53.653 --> 00:53:56.356
And in a few hours
you will be safe at home!

605
00:53:57.488 --> 00:54:01.435
What do you want?
My brother? My sister-in-law?

606
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:04.021
My dear Miss Mallison,
I am trying to help you.

607
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:08.155
- Kastner, is that it?
- Oh, such imagination!

608
00:54:08.242 --> 00:54:10.281
You think he'll come for me!

609
00:54:16.788 --> 00:54:19.491
What do you think will happen to you
when people hear what you've done?

610
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.144
There has been no complaint
from the authorities.

611
00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:24.176
Perhaps no one saw what happened to you.

612
00:54:24.749 --> 00:54:29.243
- There'll have a pretty good idea by
now. - Berlin is a strange, large city.

613
00:54:29.334 --> 00:54:33.330
There are many reasons why a young girl
should simply vanish from the streets.

614
00:54:33.419 --> 00:54:36.056
Especially one who has already
shown a tendency...

615
00:54:36.108 --> 00:54:38.870
to make rash and unsavoury friendships.

616
00:54:38.963 --> 00:54:43.006
Believe me, what I am suggesting
is for your own good.

617
00:54:45.008 --> 00:54:48.955
- I'm sorry but I don't believe you.
- Very well.

618
00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.298
You're not going to let me go?

619
00:54:52.386 --> 00:54:54.449
Not for the time being.

620
00:54:54.501 --> 00:54:58.253
Knock on the door when you have changed
your mind: someone will hear you.

621
00:55:04.016 --> 00:55:07.215
I will risk it and take her back.
The girl will only make trouble for you.

622
00:55:07.267 --> 00:55:08.465
I am used to trouble.

623
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:09.716
I will take her off your hands...

624
00:55:09.768 --> 00:55:12.212
and put her across the frontier
at the Brandenburger Tor.

625
00:55:12.227 --> 00:55:14.266
Or just a little bit further, eh?

626
00:55:15.297 --> 00:55:18.157
You have in mind, perhaps,
presenting yourself in the West...

627
00:55:18.209 --> 00:55:20.550
as the heroic rescuer of this girl.

628
00:55:20.564 --> 00:55:24.462
No, my friend. My way will work.
Leave it to me.

629
00:55:50.077 --> 00:55:53.775
- l want to talk to you, Susanne.
- Is it about leaving Berlin?

630
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:57.817
- Making a new life somewhere else?
- So you wanted to play with fire, huh?

631
00:55:57.913 --> 00:56:00.362
Cheap thrills you get
only in an amusement park.

632
00:56:00.414 --> 00:56:02.342
Next time ride a roller-coaster!

633
00:56:02.415 --> 00:56:04.270
You don't frighten me. It's true!

634
00:56:04.322 --> 00:56:06.042
You don't think I'm still
going to believe you?

635
00:56:06.094 --> 00:56:09.248
You know now what there is to be known
about me. I won't waste time on that.

636
00:56:09.335 --> 00:56:11.825
But believe me, today
they were after Bettina.

637
00:56:11.877 --> 00:56:14.795
I knew nothing of it.
They don't trust me here anymore.

638
00:56:14.847 --> 00:56:18.453
- They probably have their reasons.
- You were taken by mistake.

639
00:56:18.547 --> 00:56:22.245
Yes, yes, it's true. Not even Halendar
would dare to do this to a foreigner.

640
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:26.154
- Then he'll have to let me go. - He
failed in the attempt to get Kastner.

641
00:56:26.217 --> 00:56:28.134
Poor Halendar, he is desperate.

642
00:56:28.186 --> 00:56:30.114
By bringing you here he
made a serious blunder.

643
00:56:30.177 --> 00:56:32.880
Perhaps too serious for him
to acknowledge. Do you understand?

644
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:36.837
It would be convenient--most
convenient--if you simply disappeared.

645
00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:38.968
He is surprisingly good
at making such arrangements.

646
00:56:48.434 --> 00:56:52.512
I'm not trying to frighten you--
this is the truth. Listen to me, please!

647
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:56.719
Halendar is convinced that a word from
you will bring Kastner into the East.

648
00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:58.199
You haven't the nerve to keep me here.

649
00:56:58.251 --> 00:57:00.283
If you were in the hands of the
Government, that would be true.

650
00:57:00.335 --> 00:57:02.107
Halendar is not the government;
neither am I.

651
00:57:02.159 --> 00:57:04.921
He is just a gangster out to get
what he can from any source.

652
00:57:04.983 --> 00:57:07.526
- How could you think that--
- If you do what Halendar asks...

653
00:57:07.578 --> 00:57:09.402
and agree to be outside
the Opera tonight,

654
00:57:09.454 --> 00:57:12.476
I will instantly send word to Kastner
to stay away--that it is a trap.

655
00:57:12.528 --> 00:57:15.394
This will be our chance:
I will get you away.

656
00:57:15.446 --> 00:57:17.895
I am not such an idiot as to pretend
that I would do this for your sake.

657
00:57:17.947 --> 00:57:19.354
It is for my own sake!

658
00:57:20.156 --> 00:57:22.646
- Why? Is there a reward?
- Reward?

659
00:57:24.199 --> 00:57:27.638
Halendar has dug up the records
of certain difficulties I've had...

660
00:57:27.691 --> 00:57:31.025
with the Police in the West.
He is blackmailing me with them.

661
00:57:31.077 --> 00:57:34.152
I must do something to prove
my good intentions to the West.

662
00:57:34.204 --> 00:57:36.933
What you might call active remorse.

663
00:57:37.038 --> 00:57:39.102
If I return you to the
bosom of your family...

664
00:57:39.154 --> 00:57:41.290
this will help me quite a bit
with the Police over there.

665
00:57:41.373 --> 00:57:45.534
They will take a more lenient view
of my case. That is my motive.

666
00:57:45.625 --> 00:57:48.079
At least it sounds selfish enough
to be true.

667
00:57:48.168 --> 00:57:52.294
I need this glory! I will not allow
Kastner to take it away from me.

668
00:57:53.087 --> 00:57:56.036
If I did agree to be outside
the Opera tonight...

669
00:57:56.088 --> 00:57:58.589
how do I know you'd stop
Kastner from coming?

670
00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.421
You lied too well before.

671
00:58:01.632 --> 00:58:03.255
Believe me now.

672
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:39.976
When Kastner comes, our men are waiting
for him. They're watching every street.

673
00:58:41.982 --> 00:58:45.230
- Better get the girl out here now.
- Good.

674
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:31.619
At least tell me what I'm to do.

675
00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.337
The big grey saloon is Halendar's.

676
00:59:59.973 --> 01:00:02.510
The man in the front seat
is one of his guards.

677
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.093
When I give you the signal to go,
don't stop to think; don't hesitate; go.

678
01:00:08.185 --> 01:00:11.101
And keep going: no matter what happens
around you, keep going.

679
01:00:15.855 --> 01:00:19.802
- When? At least tell me when!
- About the time the Opera ends.

680
01:00:19.898 --> 01:00:21.688
Just keep your eyes open.

681
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.337
- Listen! - It seemed unusually
long tonight, didn't it?

682
01:03:04.217 --> 01:03:08.295
You didn't say goodnight
to Herr Halendar. He will be furious.

683
01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:09.381
Look!

684
01:03:21.099 --> 01:03:25.225
- I really thought you were being
arrested. - How sweet of you to worry.

685
01:03:30.686 --> 01:03:34.054
I've never tried these spikes before.
It's one of our tricks.

686
01:03:56.114 --> 01:03:58.022
It seems to work very well.

687
01:04:00.199 --> 01:04:03.068
And now, permit to present
Herr Letz and Herr Vollmer.

688
01:04:03.158 --> 01:04:04.154
How do you do.

689
01:04:05.159 --> 01:04:07.530
They looked quite like
real Policemen, didn't they?

690
01:04:13.038 --> 01:04:16.701
Here is the border. Young lady,
better you do not speak English now.

691
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:19.409
A-ha, looks as if they
were expecting us.

692
01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:25.414
There's a smell of Halendar in this.

693
01:04:26.752 --> 01:04:29.870
There are lots of other roads.
He can't have tied up everything yet.

694
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:52.132
Careful now. Potsdamer Platz.

695
01:05:08.186 --> 01:05:11.718
I will take a look. Don't run away.

696
01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:55.143
It's no good here.
They are checking everybody...

697
01:05:55.195 --> 01:05:57.123
so I've told them to get
to Horst's grandmother.

698
01:05:57.206 --> 01:06:00.656
She has a job at the new building in
the Frankenstrasse. They can hide there.

699
01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:03.239
- What about us?
- We take the train: it goes across.

700
01:06:59.545 --> 01:07:00.795
Here we should go separately.

701
01:07:00.848 --> 01:07:04.078
You stay on this side and watch me
so that you know where to turn.

702
01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:07.815
Alright?

703
01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:11.850
I didn't think I should ever
be sorry to see you go.

704
01:07:12.613 --> 01:07:13.857
And don't hurry.

705
01:07:46.377 --> 01:07:47.372
No thank you.

706
01:09:02.159 --> 01:09:04.702
We will join the others where
they're putting up that new building.

707
01:09:04.754 --> 01:09:05.692
Are you hungry?

708
01:09:05.744 --> 01:09:08.714
- Not a bit. - The boy's grandmother
will give us something to eat.

709
01:09:08.766 --> 01:09:10.954
She runs a sausage-stand
for the workers.

710
01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:41.755
They will be able to hide us.

711
01:10:03.685 --> 01:10:05.508
The other two haven't
turned up yet in the car...

712
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.322
but she knows someone who
has a motorcycle and a sidecar.

713
01:10:12.355 --> 01:10:14.845
Quite soon you will be safe at home.

714
01:10:17.482 --> 01:10:20.268
I said some things to you... before...

715
01:10:20.358 --> 01:10:23.607
The things you said about me
were quite true. They still are true.

716
01:10:24.318 --> 01:10:25.314
I'm sorry.

717
01:10:25.402 --> 01:10:27.559
Don't be confused by gratitude.

718
01:10:32.989 --> 01:10:37.233
- Should I be grateful?
- I suppose not, really.

719
01:10:39.491 --> 01:10:41.945
Soon I will have to say goodbye to you.

720
01:10:42.034 --> 01:10:45.697
I suppose I can't ask you
to hold me in good memory.

721
01:10:46.328 --> 01:10:48.449
But sometimes it was quite nice,
wasn't it?

722
01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:53.698
- You weren't lying all the time,
were you? - No, not all the time.

723
01:10:54.706 --> 01:10:58.571
I had a terrible conscience when I found
out that you knew the truth about me.

724
01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.521
Since the war, I had forgotten that
people like you existed.

725
01:11:01.574 --> 01:11:03.970
I tried to get out of it, but...

726
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:09.369
It wasn't so easy making that telephone
call. I am glad you didn't come.

727
01:11:11.338 --> 01:11:13.246
Will we ever go skating again,
do you think?

728
01:11:13.922 --> 01:11:17.040
I don't believe the prisons
have ice-rinks.

729
01:11:18.466 --> 01:11:22.627
Well, I'll have to start practicing in
England--perhaps you may come over.

730
01:11:25.219 --> 01:11:28.917
- I nearly did go to England once.
- You did?

731
01:11:29.012 --> 01:11:33.054
Our plans were altered.
The war--you remember?

732
01:11:34.639 --> 01:11:37.425
I suppose you were about
ten years old at the time.

733
01:11:38.474 --> 01:11:42.304
No, I don't think skating in England
is for us, Susanne.

734
01:13:59.659 --> 01:14:02.409
- Susanne, you are going with Vollmer.
- What about him?

735
01:14:02.493 --> 01:14:06.192
- Kindly restrain your humanitarian
instincts. - Why?

736
01:14:06.995 --> 01:14:11.240
Won't it help you with the
Western Police if he gets through?

737
01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:13.701
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

738
01:14:14.415 --> 01:14:15.659
I don't want to go.

739
01:14:16.457 --> 01:14:17.915
Alright, suit yourself.

740
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.754
They will never get away
in these lights.

741
01:14:44.469 --> 01:14:49.543
Such a wonderful machine. To think that
it produces all the electric lighting!

742
01:15:03.644 --> 01:15:04.888
Do you speak English?

743
01:15:07.812 --> 01:15:10.349
I will try to get him around
the other side.

744
01:15:10.438 --> 01:15:11.522
When you hear me shout...

745
01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.700
I want you to take something heavy
and smash some part of this.

746
01:15:14.773 --> 01:15:17.808
This is very beautful:
try to look pleased.

747
01:15:23.694 --> 01:15:25.235
Here is the fuel pipe.

748
01:15:26.445 --> 01:15:28.602
This is a wonderful part
for you to smash.

749
01:16:24.553 --> 01:16:29.011
- Do you have a head for heights?
- Oh, no. I'm not very good at heights--

750
01:16:51.939 --> 01:16:55.769
The next building--over the roof!
Don't show yourself.

751
01:18:08.138 --> 01:18:11.968
What's the matter? It's quite safe.
Come on--quickly!

752
01:19:01.994 --> 01:19:04.662
Don't faint now:
you'll spoil everything.

753
01:19:04.745 --> 01:19:07.530
- But I heard a shot.
- Don't worry about me.

754
01:19:07.621 --> 01:19:11.533
I was born to hang. Horst must take
a message to your brother.

755
01:19:11.623 --> 01:19:15.488
We can't chance it again tonight. In
the morning traffic it will be easier.

756
01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.563
Go to Major Mallison.

757
01:19:17.615 --> 01:19:20.376
Tell him to send a car or a van of
some sort first thing in the morning.

758
01:19:20.429 --> 01:19:24.545
A van will be better. We will be
somewhere within these three streets.

759
01:19:24.628 --> 01:19:29.169
But the van must circle the area slowly.
I will find some way to signal.

760
01:19:29.255 --> 01:19:32.207
I could ride out on my bicycle, no?

761
01:19:32.298 --> 01:19:37.372
No. Tomorrow you must go to school.
No more letters of excuse.

762
01:19:38.051 --> 01:19:40.421
It is necessary for a boy
to go to school.

763
01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:42.380
Do you hear?

764
01:19:45.637 --> 01:19:49.134
- I will see you again?
- Of course.

765
01:19:49.222 --> 01:19:52.340
And don't worry
if I should be busy for a little while.

766
01:19:52.432 --> 01:19:56.344
- If you need anything, go to Miss
Susanne. - Yes, Horst. Come to see me.

767
01:20:07.146 --> 01:20:11.770
Go on, Horst! Deliver the message.

768
01:20:32.782 --> 01:20:36.694
He's young, you see--he's only a boy.
He takes life seriously.

769
01:20:37.367 --> 01:20:38.695
He's very fond of you.

770
01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:42.985
- Isn't he?
- A boy like that feels lonely.

771
01:20:46.246 --> 01:20:49.115
He attaches himself to someone.
It is natural.

772
01:20:50.331 --> 01:20:53.081
You hate the feeling of being
loved or needed, don't you?

773
01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:57.455
- Are you cold?
- No, not really.

774
01:20:59.001 --> 01:21:02.451
Come here. They are even starting
to have Russian winters here.

775
01:21:03.003 --> 01:21:04.413
It's warm by the chimney.

776
01:21:08.755 --> 01:21:10.996
It embarrasses you...

777
01:21:11.048 --> 01:21:13.809
to have people who are fond of you
and don't mind showing it.

778
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.968
I have lived too long without
these Western luxuries.

779
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.886
Anyhow, I can't afford
the responsibility.

780
01:21:23.428 --> 01:21:25.336
Are you in love with Bettina?

781
01:21:33.891 --> 01:21:35.432
I have forgotten.

782
01:22:51.423 --> 01:22:52.585
Lock the door.

783
01:22:57.176 --> 01:22:58.717
For her this is good money.

784
01:22:58.801 --> 01:23:02.844
This is nothing. I talk English:
I took a course.

785
01:23:02.928 --> 01:23:04.718
So, it's you two they are hunting?

786
01:23:04.804 --> 01:23:06.305
They've already seen you downstairs.

787
01:23:06.357 --> 01:23:08.232
They won't search here.
Maybe they won't even come in.

788
01:23:08.285 --> 01:23:11.411
You can keep the money and
in the morning I'll give you 500 marks.

789
01:23:11.473 --> 01:23:14.508
The times I've been promised
money in the morning.

790
01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.100
Where do you want me to put you?

791
01:23:16.152 --> 01:23:17.976
Under the bed?
There's no place here to hide!

792
01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:20.373
- Please. - Take your money and get out.
I don't want trouble with them!

793
01:23:20.425 --> 01:23:21.676
Please! Just while they
pass this floor....

794
01:23:21.728 --> 01:23:24.958
or you can leave us here: you go
outside and we will take our chances.

795
01:23:31.398 --> 01:23:32.892
It's a little late for that.

796
01:23:32.982 --> 01:23:36.432
If they find us here, they must think
you have been hiding us.

797
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:42.149
In the morning I will
give you some more.

798
01:23:49.656 --> 01:23:50.735
Come on, come on--quick!

799
01:23:52.157 --> 01:23:53.981
For the girl this is impossible.

800
01:23:54.033 --> 01:23:56.326
I'll take care of her.
Go on out--quickly.

801
01:24:08.372 --> 01:24:11.407
No, not you. Come on:
take your coat off.

802
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.483
Be smoking!

803
01:25:54.792 --> 01:25:56.783
Come on in!
Unless you like it out there.

804
01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.102
What about that little
money you promised me?

805
01:26:13.154 --> 01:26:14.456
You shall have it in the morning.

806
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:16.645
- Yes, but I always--
- We must stay here now.

807
01:26:16.697 --> 01:26:19.094
This room has been searched already:
now it is safe.

808
01:26:19.177 --> 01:26:21.797
- I run a cash business.
- You have to trust me.

809
01:26:21.887 --> 01:26:25.254
Yes, please. ... Ah, no!

810
01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:28.132
- That's a good idea. - I won't take--
- Pleading won't do any good at all.

811
01:26:28.223 --> 01:26:32.052
Alright. If you don't get through,
you won't need it anymore.

812
01:26:32.141 --> 01:26:36.432
And if you do, you can trust me
to give it back to you.

813
01:26:36.518 --> 01:26:38.633
Well, the place is all yours.

814
01:26:38.685 --> 01:26:42.072
Take good care of the furnishings.
They are priceless antiques.

815
01:26:43.104 --> 01:26:44.514
Are you going to er...?

816
01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:54.599
What I mean to say is er...
will you be er...?

817
01:26:55.692 --> 01:26:59.818
Oh, no! I have a friend
who's glad of company.

818
01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.450
Do we stay here all night?

819
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:18.077
Unless she decides to turn us in
for a better price.

820
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.108
Of course, she might get drunk
and start to babble; but otherwise...

821
01:27:30.457 --> 01:27:32.333
I know it's not elegant here.

822
01:27:32.979 --> 01:27:36.053
I know these are not your
accustomed surroundings.

823
01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:39.991
- I wish I could have got a suite.
- Or connecting rooms?

824
01:27:41.086 --> 01:27:45.082
That's right. But we shall have
to stay here until the morning.

825
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:48.706
I'm not complaining. It's fine.

826
01:27:49.382 --> 01:27:51.124
Tomorrow you...

827
01:28:06.389 --> 01:28:10.882
Tomorrow you will be back in your own
room: a schoolroom or whatever it is.

828
01:28:11.641 --> 01:28:15.387
Why don't you put your feet up and rest?
Allow me?

829
01:28:44.863 --> 01:28:45.942
Come sit here.

830
01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:48.860
No, I'm--I'm quite alright, really.

831
01:28:51.241 --> 01:28:52.236
What are you thinking?

832
01:28:54.617 --> 01:28:56.075
Nothing, really.

833
01:28:57.452 --> 01:29:01.399
- Tell me, please.
- Don't you ever get sleepy?

834
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:18.536
The things you were supposed to have
done--the things Halendar knew about--

835
01:29:19.586 --> 01:29:21.412
where they very bad?

836
01:29:26.964 --> 01:29:30.212
I do ask a lot of questions, I know.
Martin's always telling me about that.

837
01:29:30.299 --> 01:29:33.832
My respect for Major Mallison
is now sky-high.

838
01:29:35.593 --> 01:29:39.671
Yes, they were bad.
They were true, too.

839
01:29:39.761 --> 01:29:41.887
Nevermind how or why. I did them.

840
01:29:41.939 --> 01:29:45.066
No one can explain them away--
least of all myself.

841
01:29:46.431 --> 01:29:48.221
What did you do before the war?

842
01:29:51.308 --> 01:29:52.849
That's another question, isn't it?

843
01:29:55.268 --> 01:29:56.891
I was a lawyer.

844
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.101
Why did you give it up?

845
01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:06.012
I didn't. One day the law
simply vanished.

846
01:30:07.023 --> 01:30:11.397
I came out of the law university with my
head crammed with ideas of Justice,

847
01:30:11.483 --> 01:30:14.352
the Rights of Man, Trial by Jury,

848
01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:17.358
the Protection of the Innocent:
all that nonsense.

849
01:30:17.444 --> 01:30:19.299
And before I could even
open an office...

850
01:30:19.351 --> 01:30:22.685
it was all as ancient and outmoded
as the bow and arrow.

851
01:30:23.488 --> 01:30:24.582
Were you in the Army?

852
01:30:24.926 --> 01:30:29.199
From the beginning I was an efficient
unit of the Military Machine.

853
01:30:29.282 --> 01:30:32.815
Whatever orders were given to me,
I carried out--promptly.

854
01:30:33.951 --> 01:30:36.191
Aren't you going to ask me
what I did as a soldier?

855
01:30:37.744 --> 01:30:38.739
No.

856
01:30:38.828 --> 01:30:41.780
I took part in the plunder
of Holland and France.

857
01:30:42.538 --> 01:30:44.695
I saw hostages executed.

858
01:30:46.081 --> 01:30:48.894
I was ordered to a village in Prague...

859
01:30:48.946 --> 01:30:52.125
which we levelled to the dust
with everything in it.

860
01:30:55.876 --> 01:30:57.535
That shocks you, huh?

861
01:30:59.461 --> 01:31:00.540
You were ordered?

862
01:31:02.879 --> 01:31:04.254
I was ordered.

863
01:31:06.798 --> 01:31:12.381
I did not invite you to set yourself up
as my Judge and Saviour. I am innocent.

864
01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:17.340
I tell you this to explain
why I don't practice the law.

865
01:31:17.427 --> 01:31:20.105
How could I stand up in the court now,

866
01:31:20.157 --> 01:31:23.180
adjust my gown and prattle
about the Rights of Man?

867
01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:33.007
You see, little Susanne, it isn't safe
to ask questions of people.

868
01:31:34.935 --> 01:31:38.052
Why don't you forget about it
and try to get some sleep?

869
01:31:41.145 --> 01:31:44.927
- l think I understand.
- Understand what?

870
01:31:46.564 --> 01:31:49.813
Some of the things you've done
since the war.

871
01:31:49.899 --> 01:31:53.941
Nonsense! I never worried
about what was to come.

872
01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:58.190
Therefore my life lacks
what some people call its purpose.

873
01:31:59.778 --> 01:32:04.438
No, the truth is, I didn't have the
stamina or the courage to live decently.

874
01:32:05.447 --> 01:32:07.190
I understand, lvo.

875
01:32:08.407 --> 01:32:12.070
No, you don't understand.
I've told you before...

876
01:32:12.617 --> 01:32:16.992
that I did this... simply to help myself
with the Police--for no other reason.

877
01:32:18.578 --> 01:32:22.360
If you had no selfish motive, would you
really have left me there with Halendar?

878
01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:29.895
Yes. You and Bettina. Your whole family.

879
01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:32.988
Kastner... the lot of you.

880
01:32:34.668 --> 01:32:36.825
Thank you, lvo.
That's all I wanted to know.

881
01:32:42.129 --> 01:32:44.168
Are your feet cold?

882
01:32:44.881 --> 01:32:48.007
Yes. And my hands are cold.

883
01:32:49.091 --> 01:32:51.047
But your heart is the coldest of all.

884
01:32:51.592 --> 01:32:54.051
I can warm your feet for you.

885
01:32:54.103 --> 01:32:56.917
It's a pity you can't do
anything about my heart.

886
01:32:58.261 --> 01:33:02.091
- I could try.
- Why should you bother?

887
01:33:04.597 --> 01:33:06.505
You must get some sleep now.

888
01:33:07.765 --> 01:33:10.883
I'll put this around your feet.

889
01:33:12.017 --> 01:33:16.344
- Ivo, when you get out of prison...
- Yes?

890
01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.058
Will there be anyone who could help you?

891
01:33:22.146 --> 01:33:24.793
Perhaps in Western Germany
there'll be friends,

892
01:33:24.845 --> 01:33:27.242
certain persons I have
known a long time ago.

893
01:33:28.649 --> 01:33:32.192
No, Ivo. Not ones you knew
in earlier days.

894
01:33:32.244 --> 01:33:34.068
I mean who can help you really.

895
01:33:34.151 --> 01:33:35.431
You know what I mean.

896
01:33:36.902 --> 01:33:40.186
No, little girl,
such persons there will not be.

897
01:33:42.071 --> 01:33:44.561
When you get to the West
I'll help you; so will Martin.

898
01:33:44.656 --> 01:33:49.196
No you will not. You will take
the first plane back to London.

899
01:33:49.866 --> 01:33:52.534
And go on with your rich and happy life.

900
01:33:54.201 --> 01:33:55.576
I'm not rich.

901
01:33:56.869 --> 01:34:00.911
Any shelter from life
is unattainable wealth.

902
01:34:06.498 --> 01:34:08.039
What are you thinking of?

903
01:34:09.874 --> 01:34:10.870
Us.

904
01:34:14.626 --> 01:34:15.622
You and I.

905
01:34:20.212 --> 01:34:24.042
You mustn't. You're a child.

906
01:34:27.173 --> 01:34:28.832
I'm not a child.

907
01:34:48.891 --> 01:34:53.550
There was one thing more: he said
that I should ride ahead on my bicycle.

908
01:34:53.643 --> 01:34:56.346
It may be just another trick
to get hold of you.

909
01:34:56.436 --> 01:34:59.518
No, I believe him.

910
01:35:00.896 --> 01:35:04.227
- You shouldn't go.
- He's telling the truth.

911
01:35:04.314 --> 01:35:07.763
You have done very well.
Now run away home and get some sleep.

912
01:35:08.899 --> 01:35:11.088
But surely this is a matter
for the Police!

913
01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:14.266
That means their Police too--and their
Police will deny the whole story.

914
01:35:14.318 --> 01:35:16.819
We have no proof of anything
happening to your sister...

915
01:35:16.871 --> 01:35:19.685
and the only satisfaction we would get
would be 2 weeks of argument.

916
01:35:19.737 --> 01:35:20.623
No, I'll go myself.

917
01:35:20.696 --> 01:35:22.734
- And I'll go with you.
- But you couldn't help me.

918
01:35:22.822 --> 01:35:27.066
You would be only in the way. Look,
I have done this kind of matter before.

919
01:35:27.157 --> 01:35:28.698
And lvo?

920
01:35:30.283 --> 01:35:31.741
Will you bring him too?

921
01:35:35.077 --> 01:35:39.321
- I think that will be necessary.
- And then?

922
01:35:41.455 --> 01:35:43.991
That is not our problem.

923
01:35:44.081 --> 01:35:48.076
The main thing is your sister-in-law
must go back to England at once.

924
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:53.327
And... as for Ivo...

925
01:35:56.002 --> 01:36:00.827
Well, we will think of something.

926
01:36:01.588 --> 01:36:02.667
Now I must go.

927
01:36:19.137 --> 01:36:20.132
Not yet.

928
01:36:20.971 --> 01:36:24.718
- Hm?
- No sign of the van yet.

929
01:36:27.182 --> 01:36:29.257
It's quite early though.

930
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:31.388
No need to worry.

931
01:36:32.393 --> 01:36:34.799
Yesterday I tried to have you arrested.

932
01:36:36.811 --> 01:36:39.727
It might have been a less
complicated solution.

933
01:36:41.730 --> 01:36:43.472
It'll come, don't worry.

934
01:36:47.232 --> 01:36:48.227
Here it is.

935
01:37:05.698 --> 01:37:09.694
- Olaf Kastner! You?!
- Uh? Well, what's the matter?

936
01:37:09.783 --> 01:37:13.530
Now who is going to believe that I had
anything to do with getting you out?

937
01:37:14.410 --> 01:37:17.078
Get in--both of you--with the laundry.
I promised Bettina and Martin...

938
01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:19.579
I would have you washed, dried,
ironed and delivered by 7 o'clock.

939
01:37:19.662 --> 01:37:20.658
School!

940
01:37:24.498 --> 01:37:25.493
School!

941
01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:32.822
- Come on.
- Which way do you go?

942
01:37:32.918 --> 01:37:36.202
There's lot of Police at Potsdamer
Platz. I have got my own way.

943
01:37:36.294 --> 01:37:37.290
Well, good luck.

944
01:37:49.592 --> 01:37:53.539
The smell of clean laundry:
what a luxury!

945
01:37:54.719 --> 01:37:57.635
It's usual to have clean linen
on your honeymoon.

946
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:07.766
Every week will seem as long as a year,
every day as long as a week.

947
01:38:08.975 --> 01:38:12.176
At that rate we will be quite old
when we meet again.

948
01:38:13.143 --> 01:38:15.540
I shan't change a bit.

949
01:38:15.592 --> 01:38:17.364
I'll make last night a
sort of looking-glass...

950
01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:19.292
to remember just what we were like.

951
01:38:21.647 --> 01:38:23.722
Dear, how long?

952
01:38:24.773 --> 01:38:28.941
Don't wait too long.
Not for me, Susanne.

953
01:38:30.692 --> 01:38:35.684
Only good wines improve with keeping.
Time won't make me any better.

954
01:38:37.237 --> 01:38:38.232
I don't care.

955
01:38:38.987 --> 01:38:43.563
You don't know.
You don't know anything, you see?

956
01:38:43.656 --> 01:38:47.486
- I know a little more than I did.
- You know nothing.

957
01:38:47.574 --> 01:38:51.190
Nothing about men, about wine,
about life.

958
01:38:54.619 --> 01:38:56.361
You know nothing.

959
01:38:57.370 --> 01:38:59.492
I just know what I like.

960
01:39:17.795 --> 01:39:18.791
Here we are.

961
01:40:55.253 --> 01:40:56.960
Drive on!
