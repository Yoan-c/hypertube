<i>I got a feeling
this is going to be a riot</i>

3
00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.660
<i>I don't read
the news papers</i>

4
00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.134
<i>Because they all have</i>

5
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.532
<i>ugly print</i>

<i>Bring it on, bring it on</i>

7
00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.214
<i>Bring it on</i>

8
00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.109
<i>At the starting
of the week</i>

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.117
<i>At summit talks
you'll hear them speak</i>

10
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.626
<i>It's only Monday</i>

11
00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.490
<i>Negotiations breaking down</i>

12
00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.295
<i>See those leaders
start to frown</i>

13
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.394
<i>It's sword and gun day</i>

14
00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:19.573
<i>Tomorrow never comes
until it's too late</i>

15
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.114
<i>You could be sitting
taking lunch</i>

16
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.689
<i>The news will hit you
like a punch</i>

17
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.749
<i>It's only Tuesday</i>

18
00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:35.658
<i>What time is it?</i>

19
00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.359
<i>You never thought
we'd go to war</i>

20
00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.866
<i>After all the things
we saw</i>

21

<i>Tomorrow never comes

25
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.512
<i>You hear
a whistling overhead</i>

26

<i>Are you alive
or are you dead</i>

<i>Tomorrow is another day</i>

42
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.318
Nice ride.

43
00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.956
It does the job.

44
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.852
What job,
delivering pizzas?

45
00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.259
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

46
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.069
What the hell
was that?

47
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.196
What?

48
00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.806
Hey!
You talking to my girl?

49
00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.137
Oh, shit. Here we go.
Yeah.

50
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.237
She was just
admiring my ride.

51
00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:35.539
"My ride. "

52
00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.207
My grandma's Buick
could smoke

53
00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.217
that piece of shit,
trailer trash.

54
00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.014
Well, what about
your daddy's Viper?

55
00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.889
This beast's
got 500 horsepower

56
00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.084
and a Borla exhaust system.

57
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.024
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds...

58
00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.062
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

59
00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.461
Wow.
You can read the brochure.

60
00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.755
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

61
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.916
What's he gonna do?

62
00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.928
Let's make it happen.
Bring it.

63
00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.870
I got your...
I got your back.

64
00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.439
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

65
00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.441
I only race
for pink slips.

66
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.248
This car goes for 80 grand.

67
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.414
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

68
00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.384
How about me?

69
00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:03.495
Winner gets me.

70
00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.340
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

71
00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.958
Blast-off, baby!

72
00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.724
First one out
the other side...

73
00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.926
It's time.
Let's go!

74
00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.404
Ready, boys? Make it interesting, Clay.

75
00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:25.576
Shit!

76
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.256
Yeah!

77
00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.861
I thought
you loved me.

78
00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.372
Oh, well.

79
00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.612
What the hell?

80
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.799
Guess I got
a new date for prom.

81
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.874
Clay, stop the car!
Shut up!

82
00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:45.846
Clay, stop the car!

83
00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:46.949
Shut up!

84
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.254
Stop it!

85
00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.893
Clay, please stop!
Please stop!

86
00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.063
Can I get
a copy of that?

87
00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:12.372
You think
this is a joke, huh?

88
00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.642
You see Ken and Barbie
over there?

89
00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:18.582
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

90
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:21.085
Mommy and Daddy
are too hooked up.

91
00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:26.119
But I like
screw-ups like you.

92
00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:27.625
You know why?

93
00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:30.491
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

94
00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.593
Where's my car?
I crushed it.

95
00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:33.791
You did what?

96
00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:35.026
Sit down! You're done.
Easy, easy.

97
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.500
You're done. You
understand me? You're done.

98
00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:39.402
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

99
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.767
Sean.

100
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.374
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

101
00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:49.306
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

102
00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.648
It's, uh, it's Miss.

103
00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:59.653
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

104
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.292
It's a tough state.

105
00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.528
And it's
a pretty clear-cut case.

106
00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:15.401
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

107
00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:20.278
This is our third town
in two years.

108
00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:23.473
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

109
00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.540
willful destruction
of property.

110
00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.586
This makes it
strike three.

111
00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:30.281
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

112
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.189
Well, there's
just got to be another way.

113
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.435
So, where are we
moving this time?

114
00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:49.099
We are not
moving anywhere.

115
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:45.415
Sean.

116
00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:48.349
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

117
00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.054
Today is the 7th.

118
00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:53.988
Well, look,
just hold on one second.

119
00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.691
Come on in.

120
00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.097
This is it.

121
00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:37.835
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

122
00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.969
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

123
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:43.674
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

124
00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.881
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

125
00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.583
So, how is your mom?

126
00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.254
Where do I sleep?

127
00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:59.292
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

128
00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:02.095
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

129
00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:04.933
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away

130
00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:06.972
every time
you get into trouble.

131
00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.963
Worked for you.

132
00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:14.776
Look, neither of us
asked for this.

133
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.316
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

134
00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:21.777
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

135
00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.788
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

136
00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:25.417
Rules?

137
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:28.085
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

138
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.094
You go to school,

139
00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.823
you come back here
right after.

140
00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:33.758
And I don't
want to see or hear

141
00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:35.697
about you
anywhere near a car.

142
00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:40.233
Here,
the bedroom is yours.

143
00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:48.070
Make yourself comfortable.

144
00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.176
Lights out in 10.

145
00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.736
You got to be kiddin'.

146
00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.536
Wrong train.

147
00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:54.505
I'm new here.

148
00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.308
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

149
00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.372
Japanese food
is like the Army.

150
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.875
Don't ask, don't tell.

151
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.445
Name's Twinkie.

152
00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.539
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

153
00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:14.578
Yeah?

154
00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:17.317
I'll hook you up.
Half price.

155
00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.855
No, I'm cool.

156
00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.415
60% off. Hmm?

157
00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.552
Since we're both army
brats and everything.

158
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.154
I ain't got no cash,
man.

159
00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.062
And I ain't
an army brat.

160
00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.498
All right, all right.

161
00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.160
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

162
00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:34.332
Everybody needs
a cell phone.

163
00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:35.971
No offense,

164
00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:37.570
but I'm probably
not gonna be here

165
00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.474
long enough
to remember your name.

166
00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:43.581
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

167
00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:45.116
You like Michael Jordan?

168
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.717
I love Michael Jordan.

169
00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:49.510
Check this out.

170
00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:52.346
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

171
00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:55.655
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

172
00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:59.854
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

173
00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.366
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

174
00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:04.966
Man, I even paid
retail for it.

175
00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:06.863
What you drive?

176
00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.600
My ride?
Yeah.

177
00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.301
My ride's one of a kind.

178
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.535
Show me.

179
00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:14.702
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

180
00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:16.741
All right.

181
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.667
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

182
00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:44.470
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

183
00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:49.380
<i>Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

184
00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:53.680
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

185
00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:55.117
<i>My life be like</i>

186
00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:57.587
<i>It's times like these
that make me say</i>

187
00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:59.988
<i>Lord if you see me
please come my way</i>

188
00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:02.458
<i>Leavin' bread crumbs
for when I stray</i>

189
00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.859
<i>Rely on sacrifice
and the price you paid</i>

190
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.457
<i>Feel me like a fingertip</i>

191
00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:11.798
Slamming, huh?
Look at that car.

192
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.633
<i>Tryin' not to quench your
fire with the things I do</i>

193
00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.570
At least let me drive.

194
00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:18.107
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

195
00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:20.235
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

196
00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:21.870
Well, all right.

197
00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.881
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

198
00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.974
You look a little nervous.

199
00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.042
What up, Tosh?

200
00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:48.763
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

201
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.243
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

202
00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:55.243
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

203
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.306
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

204
00:21:58.383 --> 00:22:02.513
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

205
00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:04.919
For when you
blow your wad, man.

206
00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:51.697
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

207
00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:03.640
Hear that?

208
00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.546
It's still not right
for the way I drive.

209
00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:10.821
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

210
00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:13.289
Okay.
Then we're done here.

211
00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:18.759
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

212
00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.861
Boys.

213
00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:24.265
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

214
00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:27.033
I'm a guy.
It's in my DNA.

215
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.203
So y'all race
with these things, huh?

216
00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:32.639
Cute little toys.

217
00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:37.010
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

218
00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.982
<i>Don't you mean uwabaki?</i>

219
00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:41.652
Neela, right?

220
00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:44.321
You're a quick learner.

221
00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.821
So, where you from,
anyway?

222
00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:50.020
Here.

223
00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:52.156
No, I mean,
not where you live.

224
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.857
Where'd you come from?

225
00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:56.025
Does it really matter
where I'm from?

226
00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:05.503
Who's the tourist?

227
00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:10.445
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

228
00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:12.005
You're moving up
in the world.

229
00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.744
You gotta
elevate your company.

230
00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:15.480
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

231
00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.021
God. Girl.

232
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.022
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

233
00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:24.686
All right, beautiful.
Hold up.

234
00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:25.752
Hey!

235
00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:28.431
He was just leaving.

236
00:24:33.004 --> 00:24:35.438
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

237
00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.946
<i>Understand that?
Gaijin?</i>

238
00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:43.241
Takashi.

239
00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:45.340
We were just talking.

240
00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:47.282
This isn't your scene.

241
00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:52.249
<i>That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,</i>

242
00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:54.985
what does that mean
exactly?

243
00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:58.421
Means, turn around,

244
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:00.725
keep walking.

245
00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.130
That's exactly
what we gonna do.

246
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.292
Come on, man,
let's roll.

247
00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:04.835
<i>Yo, look, man,
he's yakuza.</i>

248
00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:07.872
Now, see, that's funny,

249
00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:10.999
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

250
00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:14.778
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

251
00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:19.783
You know who I am,
boy?

252
00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:24.316
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

253
00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:31.321
Leave.

254
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.624
<i>Damn, man.
You know yakuza? The Mafia?</i>

255
00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.392
<i>Look, sorry, DK- san.</i>

256
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.438
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

257
00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.301
Hey, D, let's go.

258
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.739
It's time to race.

259
00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.744
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

260
00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:02.282
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

261
00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:06.855
Then let's race.

262
00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:12.694
With what, huh?
Your skateboard?

263
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.738
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

264
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.741
Take mine.

265
00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:25.213
Let's race.

266
00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.848
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

267
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.120
Can he drive?

268
00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:42.699
Can he drive?

269
00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:46.830
You know what DK
stands for?

270
00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.205
Donkey Kong?

271
00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:51.006
Drift King.

272
00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:53.804
Drift?

273
00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:56.747
What do you mean,
drift?

274
00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.951
Still need
a dictionary?

275
00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:13.523
You know that
real famous painting?

276
00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:15.998
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

277
00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:17.056
<i>The Mona Lisa.</i>

278
00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.261
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

279
00:27:18.336 --> 00:27:19.928
Well, look, man,
this car right here's

280
00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.632
<i>like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.</i>

281
00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:24.536
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

282
00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.076
We talking forged pistons,

283
00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:29.409
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

284
00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:33.447
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

285
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.751
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...

286
00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:40.313
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

287
00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:41.484
Hand braking
is the easiest,

288
00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:42.617
so the first thing
I want you to do,

289
00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:43.922
I want you
to rip that e-brake.

290
00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.121
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

291
00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:46.993
then I want you
to power over.

292
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.994
You know what?

293
00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.592
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

294
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.401
All right.

295
00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.518
Ready.

296
00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.019
Set.

297
00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:54.956
Go!

298
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.105
I told you.

299
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:19.175
Damn it!

300
00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:07.124
Damn it!

301
00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.393
Don't leave town.

302
00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:08.244
Do you know
what time it is?

303
00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.581
I thought
it was around 7:00.

304
00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:13.951
You know,
US is a few hours behind.

305
00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:19.796
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

306
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.760
Have you been racing, Sean?

307
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.569
You're out of here.

308
00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.340
Go ahead.

309
00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.643
You don't get it,
do you?

310
00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:40.843
You have
nowhere else to go.

311
00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:42.583
If it doesn't
work out here,

312
00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.678
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

313
00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.626
This isn't a game.

314
00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:52.323
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

315
00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:54.058
if you're gonna
live under my roof,

316
00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:57.033
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

317
00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:59.200
Understand?

318
00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:01.929
Understand?

319
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.102
Yes, sir.

320
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:55.987
Get in.

321
00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:58.595
I'll get you your money.

322
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.826
Why you talking
like you have a choice?

323
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.072
There's a guy in there
with a paw

324
00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.945
that owes me some money.

325
00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:20.176
A paw?

326
00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.482
Go get me my money.

327
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.655
Okay.

328
00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.811
Han said,

329
00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:26.950
<i>okane.</i>

330
00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:37.550
<i>Han said, okane.</i>

331
00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.787
Let's go.

332
00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:18.826
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

333
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:21.497
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

334
00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:23.130
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog

335
00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:24.902
or in bed with Beyoncé.

336
00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.603
I call, you show.

337
00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.543
Only if you teach me
how to drift.

338
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.545
This ain't a negotiation.

339
00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:33.746
I wasn't negotiating.

340
00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:24.030
What's he doing here?

341
00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:26.126
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can

342
00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:28.068
sitting in my garage.

343
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.004
Hope
he's not driving.

344
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.304
<i>Gaijin.</i>

345
00:38:35.546 --> 00:38:37.207
When is your next race?

346
00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.009
I'd really like to be there.

347
00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:42.017
Why not be in it?

348
00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:48.658
You heard me.

349
00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:51.891
Ready to lose
another car, Han?

350
00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:55.493
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

351
00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.732
All right.

352
00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.970
Put up the '72 Skyline.

353
00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.198
Done.

354
00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:07.369
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

355
00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:12.578
Get him out of here.

356
00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:15.511
We have business
to discuss.

357
00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:27.394
Your shipment's late.

358
00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:30.593
Since when are you
so worried about the details?

359
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.961
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

360
00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:39.068
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

361
00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.726
Hey, Dad, it's me.

362
00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.193
Uh, I had to
stay after school

363
00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:06.133
for some
extracurricular activities.

364
00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.134
So I'll be home
a little later.

365
00:40:11.842 --> 00:40:12.900
Sir.

366
00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:18.214
You really need to stop
following me around.

367
00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:20.283
What are you
doing here?

368
00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:22.485
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend

369
00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:24.043
for some drifting lessons.

370
00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:26.349
Trust me.

371
00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:28.221
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

372
00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:30.622
It's good enough for you.

373
00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.685
You don't know
anything about me.

374
00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:35.061
Well, why don't you
think I know?

375
00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:37.532
<i>'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?</i>

376
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.637
Let me guess.

377
00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.834
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

378
00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:46.399
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

379
00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:49.446
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

380
00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:52.846
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

381
00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:58.351
Zero for one, cowboy.

382
00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:12.126
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

383
00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.864
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

384
00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:17.734
<i>Mamacita, oh my God,
I think your on fire</i>

385
00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.776
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

386
00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.108
Is everything okay
back there?

387
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.472
I can handle DK.

388
00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.314
<i>I thought he's yakuza.</i>

389
00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.714
<i>His uncle's yakuza.</i>

390
00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:34.190
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

391
00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.619
But I need him.

392
00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:42.560
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

393
00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:44.728
What do you mean?

394
00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.670
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action

395
00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:49.365
from everyone
on his turf.

396
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.101
We're on his turf.

397
00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:54.004
50% of something
is better than

398
00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.739
100% of nothing.

399
00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:59.913
So have you raced DK?

400
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.778
Why not? Is he that good?

401
00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:05.380
What's the point
of a race?

402
00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:08.891
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

403
00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:10.984
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

404
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.528
If I were to race,
it would have to be

405
00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.496
for something important.

406
00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:16.556
Or why else do it at all?

407
00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.837
Why are you
letting me race?

408
00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.135
'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.

409
00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.439
And you owe me a car.

410
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:34.107
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

411
00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:39.554
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

412
00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:44.659
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

413
00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:49.057
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

414
00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:50.225
Oh, shit.

415
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.828
<i>I make ya smile right</i>

416
00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:58.935
What the...

417
00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:01.603
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

418
00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:03.169
You can do
better than 180 k,

419
00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.545
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

420
00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.244
<i>'Cause its just nice you lookin
different sayin' to yourself</i>

421
00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.843
You know what?

422
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.785
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

423
00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.187
<i>When my chain keep linkin'
like Christmas lights</i>

424
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.624
<i>Mamacita, oh my God
I think your on fire</i>

425
00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:23.495
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

426
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:28.931
Danny!

427
00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:31.636
You're looking good.

428
00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:35.972
Disco.

429
00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.148
We gotta catch up.

430
00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:45.711
Get you a drink on me, huh?

431
00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.051
Let's go.

432
00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:03.306
Aha. Easy now, ladies.

433
00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:07.504
Come on.

434
00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:11.207
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy</i>

435
00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:13.647
What's up?
How you doing?

436
00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:15.048
Hey, baby.

437
00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:17.952
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,

438
00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:20.013
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

439
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.421
<i>Can I get that number</i>

440
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:23.153
<i>Big hot pockets,
feya, ugly</i>

441
00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:25.286
<i>Corny, busted,
chopped, straight fugly</i>

442
00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:27.023
<i>British guys playing rugby</i>

443
00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:28.587
<i>Brooklyn boys

444
00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:30.429
<i>Skanky, cranky,

<i>Slammin dudes

<i>G'Doonk G'Doonk,

447
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.265
Keep your hands
off the kid, girls.

448
00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:36.829
He's underage.

449
00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:38.898
<i>Country boys and them boys

450

Ladies, ladies, ladies.

451
00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.873
Disneyland
for grownups, huh?

452
00:44:42.946 --> 00:44:44.379
All these girls, man,
they look like...

453
00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:45.847
What, models?

454
00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:46.974
Check it out.

455
00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:48.814
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital

456
00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.251
on this side of the planet,
all right?

457
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.753
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

458
00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.221
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

459
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.882
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

460
00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:56.448
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't

461
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.518
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

462
00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.028
And most of
the guys around here are

463
00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:01.826
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

464
00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.560
So what do you do?

465
00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:07.665
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

466
00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:08.830
Yeah.

467
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.867
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

468
00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.466
I tear it up.

469
00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.136
That's my thing.

470
00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:16.268
Yo.

471
00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.945
<i>You should
slow it down papi</i>

472
00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:22.815
<i>You sound like

473
00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:24.445
Sean!

474
00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.681
<i>But you're
just plain sloppy</i>

475
00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:30.188
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

476
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.391
<i>It's dipset Bitch</i>

477
00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:39.434
<i>There it go
Baby don't stop now</i>

478
00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.737
<i>There you go
Damn shorty look good</i>

479
00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.333
<i>And I'm thinkin' about
gettin' at her</i>

480
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:48.969
<i>Okay,
time to whistle at her</i>

481
00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:53.983
<i>Ay girl,
you make my whistle blow</i>

482
00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.780
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

483
00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:57.983
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

484
00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:00.350
<i>Top down
and I'm at it again</i>

485
00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:02.152
<i>It's hot now
and I'm at it to win</i>

486
00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.523
<i>You heard me</i>

487
00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:04.618
<i>Who want it with me</i>

488
00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:06.754
<i>Nobody wanna it with me
Oh, I'm so fly</i>

489
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:07.922
<i>Oh, Mami, Back up</i>

490
00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:09.397
<i>Move it till you feel
something hard on your back</i>

491
00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:11.195
The red Evo's yours.

492
00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.600
<i>If u want it come and get it
I ain't kiddin' I'm with it</i>

493
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.331
<i>Here it go, go</i>

494
00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:20.240
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

495
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.335
<i>There it go
Yeah, just like that</i>

496
00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:24.840
What do you mean?

497
00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:27.276
You're representing
me now.

498
00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:29.876
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

499
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.723
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

500
00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.408
Oh, man.

501
00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:03.942
Damn it.

502
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.619
My mother,
she's blind in one eye

503
00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.526
and she can drift
better than that.

504
00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:18.259
Han,
where did you find this guy?

505
00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:22.199
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

506
00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:47.420
Is that yours?

507
00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:49.694
Sure is.

508
00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:58.536
What happened?

509
00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:03.211
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

510
00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.684
It's got potential.

511
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.922
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

512
00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:23.530
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

513
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.138
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered. "

514
00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:34.973
You're gonna be late.

515
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.750
Sean!

516
00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:11.643
Come on, man, you broke it.

517
00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:17.945
Hey, whoa, whoa.

518
00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:21.150
There must be
a misunderstanding.

519
00:49:21.825 --> 00:49:24.988
Out of my way,
or you're next.

520
00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:26.120
Take it easy.

521
00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.993
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

522
00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:30.363
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

523
00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.100
Touch me again...

524
00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:36.898
Here.

525
00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.033
Try not to break
this one.

526
00:49:54.424 --> 00:49:55.413
Say, man!

527
00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.050
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

528
00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:59.960
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

529
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.122
Damn!

530
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.042
Not easy saving the day,
is it?

531
00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:19.714
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

532
00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.444
You're doing
all right.

533
00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:23.746
Thanks.

534
00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:28.315
Hey.

535
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:30.618
Yeah?

536
00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:33.788
Sorry about the other night.

537
00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:36.730
Your life isn't
any of my business.

538
00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:39.700
It's okay.

539
00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:03.117
Foul!

540
00:51:04.027 --> 00:51:05.824
Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.

541
00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:07.295
Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.

542
00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:09.889
Hey, Han,
sort this wanker out.

543
00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.194
A wanker?

544
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.496
What do I look like,
a zebra?

545
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.770
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

546
00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:26.314
Well, you know
those old Westerns

547
00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:29.918
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

548
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:34.284
This is my Mexico.

549
00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:40.519
Why'd you let me
race with your car?

550
00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.894
You knew
I was gonna wreck it.

551
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.728
Why not?

552
00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:48.062
'Cause it's a lot of money.

553
00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:49.638
I have money.

554
00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:53.840
It's trust and character
I need around me.

555
00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:57.571
You know, who you
choose to be around you

556
00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:59.672
lets you know
who you are.

557
00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.379
And one car in exchange
for knowing

558
00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:05.182
what a man's made of,

559
00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.920
that's a price
I can live with.

560
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:14.689
Look at all those
people down there.

561
00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:17.697
They follow the rules,
for what?

562
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.267
They're letting
fear lead them.

563
00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:25.299
What happens if they don't?

564
00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:28.135
Life's simple.

565
00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:30.742
You make choices
and you don't look back.

566
00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:46.989
<i>So,
if you don't drift to win,</i>

567
00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:49.031
<i>what do you drift for?</i>

568
00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:50.727
<i>You really
want to know?</i>

569
00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:52.129
<i>Yeah.</i>

570
00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.493
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

571
00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:14.440
<i>There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.</i>

572
00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.283
Learn by doin' it.

573
00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.744
The first drifters
invented drifting

574
00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:20.585
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

575
00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:23.090
So feel it.

576
00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:36.799
Again!

577
00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:40.369
What's in this bag?

578
00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.002
You'll see.

579
00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:43.945
How much you got?

580
00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.447
Keep going, keep going.

581
00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:54.181
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

582
00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:00.151
Again.

583
00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.479
Again.

584
00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:35.762
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

585
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.471
Go, go, go, go!

586
00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:56.718
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

587
00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:35.986
Hey, Han.

588
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:51.807
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

589
00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.344
Pleasure doing business.

590
00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:15.180
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

591
00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:56.764
It's actually not bad.

592
00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.800
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

593
00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.996
<i>See,
I'm not a total gaijin.</i>

594
00:59:03.806 --> 00:59:05.296
I hate that word.

595
00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.801
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

596
00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:11.507
I thought
you were born here.

597
00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:14.675
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

598
00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:22.014
My mom died when I was 10.

599
00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.020
She came out here
from Australia

600
00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:26.755
when she
finished high school.

601
00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:28.294
And all I know
about her is that

602
00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:31.060
she went to work
in a hostess bar.

603
00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.330
DK's grandmother took me in.

604
00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:42.376
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

605
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.343
Me and Mom
moved around a lot.

606
00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:47.912
Mostly 'cause of me.

607
00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.250
Well,
it was all 'cause of me.

608
00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:55.657
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

609
00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.190
without even
thinking about it.

610
01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:01.456
But I realize now,

611
01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.931
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

612
01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:08.195
All that matters is knowing
what you really want

613
01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:10.901
and going after it.

614
01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:33.825
We used to come up here
when we were kids.

615
01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.630
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

616
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.260
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

617
01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.001
Things were different
back then.

618
01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:55.882
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

619
01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:59.046
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

620
01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.484
You know, we just made do.

621
01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:01.885
No one bothered us.

622
01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.850
The day I got my license

623
01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:07.418
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

624
01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.897
The day after that,
I won my first race.

625
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.960
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

626
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.700
I gotta admit, it felt good.

627
01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.805
It felt like...

628
01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:22.306
Like everything else
just disappears.

629
01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.803
No past and no future.

630
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.873
No problems.

631
01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.444
Just the moment.

632
01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:56.604
Boy needs to chill.

633
01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.310
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

634
01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.648
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

635
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.514
No. Look, that was
your third set today.

636
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.614
I mean,
them tires ain't cheap.

637
01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:20.163
DK, grab a chair.

638
01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:22.032
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

639
01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.801
Yo, come on, man, look...

640
01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.882
Stay away from her,

641
01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:42.387
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

642
01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.228
Find yourself a new driver.

643
01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.171
I'm all right.

644
01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.774
What'd you expect?

645
01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.647
You didn't just
play with fire,

646
01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.480
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

647
01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:34.673
It's over.

648
01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.023
<i>All this over a gaijin?</i>

649
01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.758
<i>I am a gaijin.</i>

650
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.400
You've changed, DK.

651
01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.575
You say I've changed.

652
01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:15.543
But we're not so different,
you and I.

653
01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:19.652
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

654
01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:28.926
They say your mom
was the best trick

655
01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:31.523
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

656
01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:33.695
Leave my mother
out of this.

657
01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:37.170
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

658
01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.099
doing anything
for a buck.

659
01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.973
Think anyone would take
a second look at you

660
01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.512
if it wasn't
for your uncle?

661
01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.693
We're the same, Neela.

662
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.763
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

663
01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.644
Do you know
who you are?

664
01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:21.973
Do you know
where you belong?

665
01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.295
Hey.

666
01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.571
Come on.

667
01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:34.798
Hey, brother.

668
01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:37.101
I vouched for you!

669
01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.141
Put my reputation
on the line for you!

670
01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:40.606
We were partners!

671
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.877
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

672
01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:46.847
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

673
01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:48.809
This is what we do.

674
01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.111
Takashi!

675
01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:59.420
What about now? Hmm?

676
01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:02.692
Is this what we do?

677
01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:05.860
Man, you need me.

678
01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:07.932
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses

679
01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.493
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

680
01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.541
Get in!

681
01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:21.947
Go! Go! Go!

682
01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.249
Come on.

683
01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.289
Sean. Sean!

684
01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:37.013
Takashi.

685
01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.529
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

686
01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.039
Okay.

687
01:17:01.249 --> 01:17:02.648
I'll go with you.

688
01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:04.311
Neela.

689
01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.696
See you when
Daddy's not around.

690
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:42.417
I'm putting you
on a plane tonight.

691
01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.549
Dad...

692
01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:45.058
Sean, don't argue with me.

693
01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.925
I did this.
I can't run away.

694
01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.121
I can't.

695
01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.825
Sean,
I'm your father.

696
01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.834
I'm responsible
for your well-being.

697
01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.461
And I'm responsible
for my mess.

698
01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.405
I gotta do this.

699
01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.580
Can you understand that?

700
01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:24.360
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

701
01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.824
You all right, man?

702
01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.326
We're leaving town.

703
01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.628
Look, I know some people...

704
01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:05.936
I can't do it, Twink.

705
01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.969
Look, DK wants your head.

706
01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.177
All right?

707
01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.673
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

708
01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.943
You're done here, bro.

709
01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.081
Maybe I should
talk to Kamata.

710
01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:23.951
What?

711
01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:26.087
DK answers to him.

712
01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:31.162
I know I just
didn't hear that.

713
01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:36.569
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

714
01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:38.629
What, are you crazy, huh?

715
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.432
Han is dead, all right!

716
01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:43.501
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

717
01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:48.172
It's all I got.

718
01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:57.953
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

719
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:13.940
What's this?

720
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.768
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it

721
01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:19.073
out of Kamata's place
alive.

722
01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.745
Don't you need it?

723
01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:29.946
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

724
01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:40.953
Sean.

725
01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.328
You need to leave.

726
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:49.796
You came to the wrong place.

727
01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:52.201
I didn't come here
to see you.

728
01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:53.835
Takashi.

729
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:23.732
You think

730
01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:29.334
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

731
01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:33.379
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you

732
01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:35.416
in the first place, sir.

733
01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:39.213
But that's not
why I really came.

734
01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:41.912
I came here
to apologize.

735
01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:47.788
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

736
01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:03.540
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

737
01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.649
How do you plan
to accomplish that?

738
01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:11.245
A race.

739
01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:19.392
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

740
01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:21.061
for us.

741
01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.662
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

742
01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.758
once and for all.

743
01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.363
We race

744
01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:33.232
and the loser leaves town
for good.

745
01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:36.141
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

746
01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:37.403
Good.

747
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.814
Then it should be easy.

748
01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:21.147
The cops
took all the cars.

749
01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.714
Hey!

750
01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:41.229
That's why she's spitting.

751
01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:06.087
We almost there, Twink.

752
01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:07.922
Couple more tweaks.

753
01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.830
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

754
01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:15.202
DK picked this road
for a reason.

755
01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:17.298
This is his mountain.

756
01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.334
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

757
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:17.470
Yeah!

758
01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:25.477
Yeah!

759
01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:26.645
Yes!

760
01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:25.903
Come on.

761
01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:38.386
Yeah! Come on!

762
01:31:38.459 --> 01:31:39.687
Come on, Sean.

763
01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.089
Let's go! Let's go!

764
01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:43.062
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

765
01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:13.489
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

766
01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:24.546
Yeah, baby!

767
01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:25.785
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

768
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.225
I told you!

769
01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:14.732
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

770
01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:18.472
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

771
01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.741
<i>Fast and furious</i>

772
01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.339
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

773
01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.748
<i>Fast and furious</i>

774
01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:26.753
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

775
01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:33.919
Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!

776
01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:36.323
Hey, check this out, man.

777
01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:39.463
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

778
01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:43.267
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

779
01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:45.168
Not tonight, Twinkie.

780
01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.269
Said he knew Han.

781
01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:58.647
Said Han was family.

782
01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:13.997
All right.

783
01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:15.493
Let's race.

784
01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.061
Nice ride.

785
01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:47.524
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

786
01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:52.299
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

787
01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.864
He was when
he was rolling with me.

788
01:36:57.478 --> 01:36:59.946
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

789
01:37:00.414 --> 01:37:02.314
I got nothing but time.

790
01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.444
You ready, kid?

791
01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.993
Come on, Sean! Come on!

792
01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.196
Ready!

793
01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:27.365
Set!

794
01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.839
Go!

795
01:40:28.288 --> 01:40:36.858
<i>You so crazy,
you so crazy</i>

796
01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:39.421
<i>Far East to West Mic Check</i>

797
01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.127
<i>1, 2, 3, 4</i>

798
01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:51.703
<i>Cho large</i>

799
01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:55.647
<i>So hot so hard
We cho large!</i>

800
01:40:55.716 --> 01:41:00.049
<i>You so crazy,
you so crazy</i>

801
01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:04.657
<i>So hot so hard
We cho large!</i>

802
01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:08.885
<i>You so crazy,
you so crazy</i>

803
01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:57.835
<i>We got big jewels,
big cars</i>

804
01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:00.038
