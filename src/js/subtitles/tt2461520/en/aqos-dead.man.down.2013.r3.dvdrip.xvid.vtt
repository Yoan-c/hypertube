00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.845
<i>It wasn't meant to be this way.
You know?</i>

3
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.249
<i>We make our plans, sure.</i>

4
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.449
But life...

5
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.127
Life
is what happens to you along the way.

6
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.333
You know, at first,
I didn't want this.

7
00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.190
I didn't want to connect.

8
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.225
I didn't want to get involved.

9
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.594
And she kept on at me.
You know?

10
00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:06.042
"This is what life is.
This is why we're here, lo connect.'

11
00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.406
"To build."

12
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.475
“We're here to build something."

13
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.952
And then we had Theo.

14
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.586
And then I understood
that she was right.

15
00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.523
We're not meant to be alone.

16
00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.364
You know what she said to me?

17
00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.575
She said
that even the most damaged heart...

18
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.177
can be mended.

19
00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.982
Even the most damaged heart.

20
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.445
Yeah.

21
00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.950
No, I'm with Vic.

22
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.216
What?

23
00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.947
I can't let you in
until Alphonse is home.

24
00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.883
Alphonse is on his way.

25
00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:31.884
Where?

26
00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.660
In the basement.

27
00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.602
Paulie.

28
00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.108
No.

29
00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.924
It's Paul.

30
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.416
Go.

31
00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.843
719... Now you realize.

32
00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.838
719... Now you realize.

33
00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.182
What?

34
00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.280
What the fuck?
This shit is crazy.

35
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.227
Now he's killing us.

36
00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.017
Call the locksmith.

37
00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:48.397
And get that asshole
from the alarm company over here.

38
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.132
“Now you realize.”

39
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.033
I know who's doing this to me.

40
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.374
What?

41
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.980
Killed for less.

42
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.648
A little uncouth
to come without a call.

43
00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.484
There's a better place
for you to be.

44
00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.752
Get out.
Go!

45
00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:28.323
Am I gonna gel paid?

46
00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:41.311
Have you seen this man?

47
00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:42.267
Paul?

48
00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:45.871
- Everyone knows Paul's missing.
- I want you to think before you answer.

49
00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.606
Cause I'm getting
to the bottom of this.

50
00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:48.774
The bottom of what?

51
00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:50.812
Three months of letters.

52
00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:53.378
Three months of torment.

53
00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.847
Not being able to leave my house
without wondering...

54
00:06:55.848 --> 00:07:00.558
if some coward
is gonna sneak up behind me and."...

55
00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.288
Paul was looking into this.

56
00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.957
And I think he found exactly
what he was looking for.

57
00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.460
But before he could come
and tell me...

58
00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:13.365
my friend Paul
shows up strangled in my freezer.

59
00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.643
You've got a lot of enemies,
don't you, Alphonse?

60
00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:22.107
Three months ago
you and I had our disagreement!

61
00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.509
I raised my lake to 25 %...

62
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.579
to allow you to continue
to operate in my buildings.

63
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.848
I started getting letters
three months ago!

64
00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.316
That's no fucking coincidence!

65
00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.517
That's not fucking accurate!

66
00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.519
You asked for 30 percent,
and Lon told you...

67
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.321
you could only ask me for 20-.

68
00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.991
So if anyone was bent out of shape,
it was you, Alphonse.

69
00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.960
Who's in this picture?

70
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.128
I don't fucking know.

71
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.234
- Who is in this picture?
- I don't know!

72
00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.935
What am I supposed to realize?

73
00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:53.538
What does 719 mean?
What am I going to fucking realize?

74
00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:55.807
What am I gonna fucking realize?

75
00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:58.109
Darcy,
want to give me a hand there, mate?

76
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.012
- He ain't got shit to do with this!
- He's fucking lying so you shut the fuck up.

77
00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:03.181
I've been picking up
from Harry for over a year.

78
00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:06.251
He's fucking lying
so you shut the fuck up.

79
00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:09.062
I'm gonna ask you again.
What am I supposed to realize?

80
00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:13.525
I don't care
what you think I've done to you...

81
00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.894
you are not sanctioned to kill me.

82
00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.129
That much I do fucking know.

83
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.265
So it's not on,
you even coming here!

84
00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:21.677
Not on?

85
00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:26.641
The term is not cool.

86
00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.574
You fucking English.
You always do shit like that.

87
00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.213
That's our system.

88
00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:41.926
And you also
make your sevens like this.

89
00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:58.109
You...

90
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.351
are not sanctioned...

91
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.313
to kill me.

92
00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.290
Fuck it.

93
00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:09.741
What the fuck y'all wailing for?

94
00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.050
Do it.

95
00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.332
Fuck, you've been hit.

96
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.869
Don't worry about it.

97
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.061
A bit better this time.

98
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.540
Will you be all right
to drive yourself home, Beatrice?

99
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.223
You're supposed to lie down
and relax.

100
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:14.769
I was relaxing so much
I saw a white light.

101
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:18.096
Well, if you see it again,
don't walk into it.

102
00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:21.340
I still have a lot of things to take out
on you for my childhood.

103
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.179
Beautiful.

104
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.145
I love the color.

105
00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:28.550
It's very PFEW-

106
00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:30.649
I'll run your bath.

107
00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:45.456
Hi, it's your neighbor who waves...

108
00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:54.429
Hello?

109
00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:58.566
Hello?

110
00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:04.371
I got your note.

111
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.012
Hi.

112
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.986
<i>Hi.</i>

113
00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:31.640
I wasn't sure that you got it.

114
00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:34.332
I was wondering
if I put it in the wrong box?

115
00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.334
No.

116
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:38.009
No. It's mine.

117
00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:48.817
So...

118
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.656
The note.

119
00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:56.964
I just thought since we...

120
00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:01.803
I thought it would be nice
lo finally meet you.

121
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.811
Beatrice.

122
00:16:13.772 --> 00:16:15.410
Victor.

123
00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:31.158
No, thanks.

124
00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.677
You don't talk a lot.

125
00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:52.018
Not much, no.

126
00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.279
It's okay.

127
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.521
I talk enough for both of us.

128
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.324
I talk too much.
Everybody says so.

129
00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.903
You speak French?

130
00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:11.562
I'd like lo.

131
00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.201
- Yeah?
- Sure.

132
00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.676
Another language?

133
00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.940
Hungarian.

134
00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.642
You're Hungarian?

135
00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:25.916
You don't have an accent.

136
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.420
I worked very hard
lo gel rid of it.

137
00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.262
So.

138
00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.868
A job.

139
00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.562
I'm, uh.-.

140
00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:44.328
Right now
I'm dabbling in real estate.

141
00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:48.099
The people I work
for buy buildings in need of renovation.

142
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.376
Fix them up and run them.

143
00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.422
You?

144
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.766
A job?

145
00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.067
Yeah.

146
00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:20.731
I was involved
in a car accident last year.

147
00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:23.269
I was a beautician before.

148
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.044
They rebuilt part of my face.

149
00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:32.550
It's kind of hard
to give advice on beauty.

150
00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.379
And, uh...

151
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.116
I have to smile a lot
in my job.

152
00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:41.030
Most of the time,
it hurts to smile.

153
00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:48.659
I don't get to smile
so much in my work.

154
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.968
- No?
- No.

155
00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:51.896
Maybe you
and I should switch jobs.

156
00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:52.807
Yeah.

157
00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.775
So, what else?

158
00:19:00.005 --> 00:19:02.073
I swear sometimes.

159
00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.608
Especially when I drink.

160
00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:04.747
Me, too.

161
00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.046
Fuck.

162
00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:09.081
Shit.

163
00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.584
Careful.

164
00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.155
You're smiling.

165
00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:23.437
Tonight it's worth it.

166
00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:36.348
I want lo take you somewhere.

167
00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:39.746
So where are we going?

168
00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.746
Are we going lo a club?

169
00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.725
No.

170
00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:43.648
No?

171
00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.491
Very cold.

172
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.149
Very cold.

173
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:45.683
Yeah.

174
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:49.928
All right.
Well, then are we going to a park?

175
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.470
Warmer.

176
00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.865
I thought you talk a lot?

177
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.433
I thought you don't?

178
00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.778
Must be the company.
Usually, I don't.

179
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.450
You can turn here.

180
00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.484
Pull over.
Just there.

181
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.363
You're afraid
I'll think you came tonight...

182
00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:34.401
because you felt sorry for me.

183
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.769
You don't have to play
these games, Victor.

184
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.613
I know why you really came.

185
00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:44.014
You're just being careful.

186
00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:45.009
You wanted to find out...

187
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.981
if the girl who's been watching you
saw what you did.

188
00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.218
I saw you...

189
00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:56.028
kill this man.

190
00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.672
I saw you strangle him.

191
00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.907
I saw you lake him away.

192
00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:20.446
Now you're trying to clean up a mess
that cannot be cleaned up.

193
00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.547
But, I...

194
00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:26.791
I think your secret
will be safe with me.

195
00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.166
This is the man...

196
00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:35.668
who hit my car
when he was drunk.

197
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.611
This is the man
who did this lo me.

198
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.310
I want you to kill him.

199
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.439
As you did with the man
in your apartment.

200
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.541
- Wait a minute.
- No.

201
00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:53.778
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and tell them what I saw.

202
00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.146
What the fuck are you...?

203
00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.914
His BMW.

204
00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:58.724
It's fixed.

205
00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:01.295
This has never happened.

206
00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:05.297
I can't be fixed.

207
00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:08.025
He sewed three weeks.

208
00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:10.161
Three weeks for what he did lo me.

209
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:13.464
Stupid Judge,
he sat there and looked at my face.

210
00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:14.498
I want it done.

211
00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:18.470
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and I'll tell them what I saw.

212
00:22:18.637 --> 00:22:20.171
You'll do it!

213
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:22.948
You want to save yourself?
Do it!

214
00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:26.613
Fuck!

215
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.783
He didn't pay-

216
00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:33.484
I understand.

217
00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:34.251
He didn't pay-

218
00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.853
Slop saying that!
I understand!

219
00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:36.887
Are you gonna do it?

220
00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:38.622
What I did it
has nothing to do with you.

221
00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.125
You have to do this!

222
00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:42.560
He ruined my life.

223
00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:44.929
I have nothing.
I am nothing.

224
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.630
I want it done
as soon as possible.

225
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:50.034
Then I will forget.
I will begin my life.

226
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.702
And I will forget
I that ever met you.

227
00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.904
- Do you know what it is to kill a man!
- And I will forget I that ever met you.

228
00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:55.940
It's not a bug! It's not a rat!

229
00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.875
I would never kill a bug or a rat!

230
00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:59.210
He's much worse
than these things!

231
00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:00.878
You don't know
what you're getting into with me!

232
00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.825
You've no fucking idea!

233
00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:10.955
I could have called the police.

234
00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.823
I saved your life.

235
00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:16.237
Now you're gonna give me back mine.

236
00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:20.773
If you're not going to kill me
you don't have a choice-.

237
00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:51.431
Beatrice.

238
00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.129
Laszlo.

239
00:24:59.130 --> 00:24:59.997
Sorry I'm late.

240
00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:03.067
You look good.

241
00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:04.668
It's good to see you.

242
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:07.479
Were you worried
I was going to forget your name.

243
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.213
Convention.
You forget what it's like.

244
00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:30.027
It's Andras who gave us
the body for your grave.

245
00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:31.996
Whose body?

246
00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:35.274
Someone who deserved it,
I'm sure.

247
00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:52.716
We met.

248
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:57.325
Two days after
when they left you for dead.

249
00:25:57.622 --> 00:25:58.930
Yeah.

250
00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:02.826
Soviet modified Dragunov.

251
00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:05.863
7.62 by 5.4 rounds.

252
00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:07.498
With Russian PSO scopes.

253
00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:10.537
Comes with bayonet
suppressor as well.

254
00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:14.538
Heavier than I expected.

255
00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.143
I'll take it.

256
00:26:27.452 --> 00:26:30.228
Okay. All set.

257
00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:34.725
What did he say?

258
00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.637
Andras?

259
00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:42.199
For 14 months
you've infiltrated Alphonse.

260
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.235
They wanted to know
why you've been waiting so long...

261
00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:47.705
to do what needs to be done.

262
00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:50.674
He said if he was lucky enough
lo be standing,like you are...

263
00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.876
he'd want revenge too.

264
00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:56.880
But we're all worried
you wait loo long.

265
00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:59.683
Always kill the devil quickly
when you find him.

266
00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:01.418
That was his advice.

267
00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:05.155
I said you wanted to be close enough
to watch him suffer.

268
00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:09.571
But I really don't know
the reason you're wailing.

269
00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:22.610
<i>So now say it in English for me.</i>

270
00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.376
I... lied

271
00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:25.943
Yes?

272
00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:29.713
I... tied... <i>my</i> shoe.

273
00:27:29.714 --> 00:27:30.948
<i>Today.</i>

274
00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:32.583
<i>You tied what?</i>

275
00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:33.984
My shoe.

276
00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:34.986
<i>Your shoe?</i>

277
00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:39.590
<i>Bigger smile than that.</i>

278
00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:42.333
<i>That's not
the biggest smile you have.</i>

279
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.642
What have I done to you?

280
00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:07.850
Where have you taken me?

281
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.283
I need foodstuffs.

282
00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.942
I can help you.

283
00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:41.812
If you let me go,
he will spare you.

284
00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:44.948
My brother
will not stop looking for me.

285
00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:47.896
And he will find you.

286
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:54.324
Even if you get his money...

287
00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:56.393
even if they pay...

288
00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:58.772
he will find you.

289
00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:06.703
You don't know
who you're messing with!

290
00:30:06.704 --> 00:30:08.581
He will kill you!

291
00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:11.883
He will kill you!

292
00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:18.048
Monster's here.

293
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:19.516
Monster!

294
00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:20.651
Hey, monster...

295
00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:24.293
if you put a bag on your head
we might hook up with you.

296
00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:28.228
MONSTER

297
00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:44.341
You have to take off
your shoes.

298
00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:47.687
My morn
likes lo keep the floor clean.

299
00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:57.489
How long will it take?

300
00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:01.032
Long enough lo be prepared.

301
00:31:03.394 --> 00:31:08.332
You say he goes to this bar...
every night.

302
00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.333
Yeah.

303
00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:11.301
You know where he works?

304
00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:13.570
He's looking for work.

305
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:16.518
As much as I could find out, I did.

306
00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:29.322
I never thought about it before.

307
00:31:29.754 --> 00:31:31.734
Revenge.

308
00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:39.598
When I saw you
kill that man in your apartment...

309
00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:44.008
I knew I had my answer.

310
00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:53.749
Why did you do it?

311
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.983
I just want to know more
about you.

312
00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:02.021
I'm not here by choice.

313
00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:11.495
We have company.

314
00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:14.807
She can't hear us.
She lost most of her hearing as a child.

315
00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:27.155
I'm looking
for my hearing aids.

316
00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:34.651
Hello.
Nice lo meet you.

317
00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:35.686
Nice lo meet you.

318
00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:38.021
Well. Very good.

319
00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:39.556
You want to stay for lunch.

320
00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:41.992
We're having chicken.
Lemon chicken. It's very good.

321
00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:44.428
And cookies.

322
00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:47.130
We love cookies
in this house.

323
00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:47.798
You want a cookie?

324
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.066
I can't stay.

325
00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:54.016
I want lo show you something.

326
00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:03.347
Pictures of Beatrice.

327
00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:06.693
You can see
she has excellent genes.

328
00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:11.824
You see
how beautiful she is?

329
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.577
I want it done
as soon as possible.

330
00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:02.606
<i>Mama“.</i>

331
00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:05.087
Victor has to go.

332
00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.348
Au revoir, Victor.

333
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.329
It was nice meeting you.

334
00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:19.600
You'll hear from me
when it's done.

335
00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.925
Cookies.

336
00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.338
It's for you.
Take them.

337
00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:31.610
A bit gfllmPY-

338
00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:21.985
Crackerjack.

339
00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:24.023
Got any grass?

340
00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.861
That depends.

341
00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:31.294
Information is power,
my friend.

342
00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:32.963
You see anyone
take a photo up here?

343
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.731
Already told.

344
00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:35.966
Already told who?

345
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:39.069
Another guy.
A guy like you.

346
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.482
This is my friend, Paul.

347
00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:44.113
Did you tell him?

348
00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:54.484
<i>Hello. Alphonse?</i>

349
00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:56.219
<i>You know,
people are ﬂipping out.</i>

350
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.088
<i>You weren't sanctioned to do Harry.</i>

351
00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:58.889
<i>or his men.</i>

352
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.491
<i>Or leave a house
full of dead Jamaicans!</i>

353
00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:04.261
- No, I told you... Look, Lon...
- Try to imagine...

354
00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.496
<i>Can you imagine
what the fuck I'm dealing with?</i>

355
00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:07.164
<i>No.</i>

356
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.865
<i>You need to come
and see me right now.</i>

357
00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.468
<i>You don't appreciate
the severity of this.</i>

358
00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:15.076
<i>You come now.
I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.</i>

359
00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.869
So...

360
00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:40.666
We got dead Jamaicans?

361
00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:43.406
I'm listening.

362
00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.837
Well, Lon.

363
00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:52.509
For the last three months,
Harry was messing with me.

364
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.377
Trying to freak me out.

365
00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:57.147
Sending little notes like this.

366
00:36:57.148 --> 00:37:02.393
With pictures and threats,
and fucked up shit.

367
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.355
719, Now you Realize...

368
00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:09.459
I don't think he was too happy
with the percentage deal.

369
00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.460
Okay.

370
00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:12.662
I went in there to gel answers...

371
00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:15.371
not dead Jamaicans.

372
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.113
Turned out that way.

373
00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:22.572
I lost two guys.

374
00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:25.976
And truth is, I could
have been just as dead as both of them.

375
00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:27.477
You know Joe Bragg?

376
00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:29.048
And Herbert?

377
00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:30.447
Lowell Khan.

378
00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:32.549
And Weinberg?

379
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.951
They're my colleagues.

380
00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:36.553
Yeah.

381
00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:38.255
Each...

382
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:42.033
received photos like these.

383
00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:05.348
Yeah?

384
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:06.716
<i>Yo, Vic.
Where're you at?</i>

385
00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.018
I'm in the middle of something.

386
00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:09.619
Hey, listen, I was right.

387
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.720
Alphonse is still in danger-.

388
00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:13.668
It's not Harry
and his men doing this shit.

389
00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.792
How do you know that?

390
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:18.561
<i>You know Cafe Cora?
Can you get there?</i>

391
00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.729
<i>I can find it.</i>

392
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.865
Alphonse
is there with Lon Gordon.

393
00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:24.067
I'm gonna call the rest of the crew
and get them down there.

394
00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.335
How'd you know it wasn't Harry?

395
00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:26.610
I'll be there in five.

396
00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:30.551
Fuck.

397
00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:33.453
Yo, Terry.

398
00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:34.344
Yeah?

399
00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:37.147
I'm gonna look at these photos
another way.

400
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:40.617
Cause whoever's doing this
ls taking it seriously enough now...

401
00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:43.953
lo let us know
that loans to you are not secure.

402
00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:47.492
That's respect enough
to let us know his intentions.

403
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.370
You're not gonna be around.

404
00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.363
You may not be around to collect.

405
00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:55.665
Lon, that's exactly
what Harry wanted you lo think.

406
00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.475
I got a note too.

407
00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.637
This morning.

408
00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:05.076
It's addressed to you.

409
00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:10.352
Englishmen and Jamaicans,
they don't send notes like this.

410
00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:12.956
Not after they've been killed...

411
00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.989
in their own house.

412
00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:31.637
719, now you realize <i>I</i> It's not the 7

413
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:35.678
What does it mean?

414
00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:39.019
What does it mean?

415
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.853
And this key...

416
00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.051
was taped to it.

417
00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:51.332
You know what that key is for?

418
00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:00.230
I want you lo get the books
and deeds together for me now.

419
00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:00.997
Fine.

420
00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:03.171
Every building you owe us for.

421
00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.836
You understand this,
don't you?

422
00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:09.506
So the uptown buildings,
you're pulling out of the deal.

423
00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.043
We're not pulling out.

424
00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:15.287
You're just in no condition
right now to pull in.

425
00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.496
Shit!

426
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.545
- Alphonse...
- Not right now.

427
00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.751
There's a problem.

428
00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:49.917
We need to go.

429
00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.478
UNKNOWN
Did you get the key

430
00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:15.572
He's here.

431
00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:16.176
What?

432
00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.507
On, shit!

433
00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:18.808
- Get down!
- Shit!

434
00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:20.220
Jesus!
Get down!

435
00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:33.198
Darcy!
He's up on the roof!

436
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:35.295
Get in the car!

437
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:37.996
Up there!

438
00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.531
9°, Q9, go, go!

439
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.403
Get the fuck out of here!

440
00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.005
Luco!
You watch the elevator!

441
00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:49.639
Yeah!

442
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.707
Dolph and Charles
come upstairs!

443
00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.619
Kilroy, back stairs with me!
Now!

444
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:29.512
Darcy,
he got out from the fifth floor.

445
00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:30.046
What?

446
00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:31.390
He went out the window!

447
00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.416
From the fifth fucking floor?

448
00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:34.418
He's crazy.

449
00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:38.089
<i>Darcy!</i>

450
00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:42.692
What the fuck?

451
00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:44.900
Shit! Fuck!

452
00:42:58.008 --> 00:42:59.316
Victor.

453
00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:14.494
Shit!

454
00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:16.926
Where is he?

455
00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:18.227
They wasted Goff.

456
00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:20.674
- They wasted Charles, too.
- Over here! Come on!

457
00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.209
Get in!

458
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.553
Come on!

459
00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.824
Over here!

460
00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:44.224
Come on!

461
00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:55.805
What the fuck are you doing?

462
00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.178
Turn the fuck around!

463
00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:09.188
Turn the fuck around!

464
00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:14.584
- What the fuck!
- Hi. I'm Beatrice.

465
00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:15.451
You told me to get here.

466
00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.253
I'm sorry I made him late.

467
00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.354
What's going on?

468
00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:19.455
See you later.

469
00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:20.857
Did you see anyone running here, Vic?

470
00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:21.257
No.

471
00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.125
On, shit!

472
00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:25.039
He took out Blotto,
Goff and even Charles.

473
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.997
We lost him.

474
00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:28.999
Fuck!

475
00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.309
You guys all right?

476
00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.304
Tell him
what you told me about the cab.

477
00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:37.106
This guy in the building...

478
00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:40.088
he saw a man
take this photo from the stairwell.

479
00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:42.645
Then they seen him getting into a cab.
A gypsy cab.

480
00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:45.348
Paul was there, loo.
Found out the same thing.

481
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.796
It must've led him to something,
because he was wasted for it.

482
00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:52.031
Find out where the cab went.

483
00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:59.195
What did you do that for?

484
00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.396
What I do what for?

485
00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:01.731
Go looking with the pictures.

486
00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:04.133
You've only been on this crew
a month longer than I have.

487
00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:05.568
What if all this shit
happening lo Alphonse...

488
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:08.482
is because of something
that went down before you came?

489
00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:12.175
This is an opportunity
of magnumus proportions to me.

490
00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:12.909
How's that?

491
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.211
Of finding my next step
in the organization.

492
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:18.081
Yeah, well there might not be much
of an organization left.

493
00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:20.817
I could run this place for him, Victor.

494
00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:24.527
Better than Terry,
a whole lot better than fucking Kilroy.

495
00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:27.533
I ain't joking around.

496
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.060
If I could just crack this shit for...

497
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.428
This is serious shit, Darcy.

498
00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:34.797
Have enough money lo buy Lise
and Theo what they need.

499
00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.232
Move up the ladder.

500
00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.610
Fuck!

501
00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:40.369
It's Lisa's car.
Mine's in the shop.

502
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.370
What?
Are you back with her?

503
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.172
Yeah,
she's acknowledging me.

504
00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.874
It's a start right?

505
00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:48.411
I promised her I'd make a plan.
Get ahead.

506
00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:51.018
For her, and for Theo.

507
00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:59.132
Just don't get too smart.

508
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.895
You saw what happened to Paul.

509
00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:05.105
- I don't want anything to happen to you.
- I'm smarter than Paul.

510
00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:07.363
I'm tired of being taken
for a fucking douche.

511
00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:09.899
- I saw Alphonse respected me there-
-Oh, yeah-.

512
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.300
I saw it in his eyes.

513
00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:13.679
Go ahead.
We're good.

514
00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:14.837
HOYT

515
514
00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.146
HOYT

516
515
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.132
Go on.

517
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.540
What the fuck.

518
00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:57.748
<i>I tied my shoe today.</i>

519
00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:06.157
<i>I tied my shoe today.</i>

520
00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:14.732
<i>I tied my shoe today.</i>

521
00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:21.137
Allo?

522
00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:23.673
<i>Hello.
This is Victor, is Beatrice...</i>

523
00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:24.373
Allo?

524
00:47:24.374 --> 00:47:27.912
Hello. This is Victor.
ls Beatrice there?

525
00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.647
Hello.

526
00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.059
It's me.

527
00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:37.687
<i>I believe
you have something of mine?</i>

528
00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.167
Yeah.

529
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.767
Why did you follow me?

530
00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.938
It's not the first time.

531
00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:50.711
I wanted lo find out
more about you.

532
00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:58.646
I think it's lucky I did-.

533
00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:32.074
You want some water?

534
00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:33.213
Sure.

535
00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:03.609
So... Who are you?

536
00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:17.892
My real name is Laszlo Kerik.

537
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.762
I was born in Hungary.

538
00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:25.899
A few years ago my wife
and I came to America.

539
00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:30.375
I was an engineer before.

540
00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:34.281
We came here looking for work.

541
00:49:35.772 --> 00:49:38.878
We took an apartment
in a building.

542
00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:43.288
It was a building
they wanted lo control.

543
00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:46.758
The men I saw?

544
00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:51.856
They got most people
out of the building.

545
00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.763
One night they came...

546
00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.626
and they fired some shots.

547
00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.295
To scare us.

548
00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:01.333
So we would leave.

549
00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:05.839
A bullet went through a wall...

550
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.383
and my daughter
was killed while she slept.

551
00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:30.398
We were going to testify.
My wife and I.

552
00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:33.396
The man responsible for it all...

553
00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.035
Alphonse.

554
00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:38.679
He gave his orders
to make sure he never went to trial.

555
00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:42.874
And they were followed.

556
00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:47.777
He was afraid to use his own guys, so...

557
00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:50.452
they sent a crew
of Albanians after us.

558
00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:54.591
They killed my wife.

559
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.828
And they thought they killed me too.

560
00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:00.733
And they should have made sure of it.

561
00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:10.336
Cigarette?

562
00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:12.540
Yeah.

563
00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.543
When I manage
to forget what happened to me.

564
00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:52.804
When there are no mirrors,
and no people that reminds me.

565
00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:55.923
And my mom makes me laugh.

566
00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:59.219
These moments.

567
00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:01.424
I have hope.

568
00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:11.363
Maman says that I...

569
00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:16.134
that it's these moments
that makes the pain bearable.

570
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.180
These moments...

571
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:24.473
I should try
and find them where I can and...

572
00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:26.283
hang onto them.

573
00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:29.712
But they're fleeting.

574
00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:31.847
And then I remember and...

575
00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:34.383
I'm filled with so much hale...

576
00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:37.422
that I want to set
the whole world on fire.

577
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.766
I'm sorry
I made you tell about your family.

578
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.999
I don't want to be one
of those people that reminds you.

579
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.446
You're the one who
is going to help me forget-.

580
00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:57.173
These men...

581
00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:59.942
They don't seem easy to beat.

582
00:52:59.943 --> 00:53:03.012
And you might
have used up all your luck.

583
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.287
So...

584
00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:12.933
It's yellow.

585
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.097
Chartreuse.

586
00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.600
Keep it.

587
00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:20.074
I need you around.

588
00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:27.945
Rabbits don't come in chartreuse.

589
00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.884
Did you eat the cookies?

590
00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.323
No.

591
00:53:43.753 --> 00:53:46.393
Maman makes a good cookie.

592
00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:51.227
I only ask you
to return the Tupperware.

593
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:53.299
She likes her Tupperware.

594
00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:08.421
Have you made any progress?

595
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.351
I will.

596
00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:13.355
I know.

597
00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:18.520
Because I realize now if I call the police
and tell them what I saw...

598
00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:20.831
it's not prison you're afraid of.

599
00:54:21.324 --> 00:54:24.703
It's that you won't get lo finish
your revenge.

600
00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:44.046
<i>I'm going to steep
in my own bed.</i>

601
00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:46.715
<i>And why are you going to sleep
in your own bed?</i>

602
00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:51.453
<i>Because Daddy
takes care of the monsters.</i>

603
00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:53.389
<i>All right, baby.
Tell me once more, all right?</i>

604
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:57.393
<i>Because Daddy keeps care
of the monsters.</i>

605
00:54:57.394 --> 00:55:00.568
<i>That's not the biggest smile
you have.</i>

606
00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:09.950
<i>That's not the biggest smile
you have.</i>

607
00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:14.243
<i>And why are you going to sleep
in your own bed?</i>

608
00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:18.814
<i>Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.</i>

609
00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.883
<i>Why baby?
Tell me once more. Why?</i>

610
00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:24.730
<i>Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.</i>

611
00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:53.148
I'm so happy that you're here.

612
00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:54.594
Yeah.

613
00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.653
I just needed some time,
Florence.

614
00:55:57.654 --> 00:55:59.531
Now I'm going to cry.

615
00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:04.498
I was worried
when you didn't contact my friend.

616
00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:07.062
Nicholas.

617
00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:07.763
The therapist.

618
00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:08.864
Oh, yeah.

619
00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:11.700
He really did wonders
helping me out.

620
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.703
He could help you.

621
00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:18.910
I found someone else.

622
00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:22.277
As long as
you're getting the help you need.

623
00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:23.689
Yeah.

624
00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:27.158
I'm in good hands.

625
00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:14.839
You clever motherfucker.

626
00:58:25.468 --> 00:58:28.506
I'm gonna open the windows.
It's fucking hot in here.

627
00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:31.306
Hey, Kilroy,
you want something to eat?

628
00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:33.082
Yeah, I could eat.

629
00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.489
I'm in my office.

630
00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:47.961
You guys want a game?

631
00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.461
Come on.

632
00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.523
Come on!

633
00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:22.993
<i>HEY-</i>

634
00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.860
anything going on?

635
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.033
No.

636
00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:29.998
Any pick ups?

637
00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:32.301
Make sure
you keep your cell on.

638
00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:34.407
I don't know
what Al's got going.

639
00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:45.581
<i>Are you sure it's the AR 43?</i>

640
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:48.083
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm looking at it right here.

641
00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.918
<i>It was installed two days ago.</i>

642
00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:52.160
Then there is nothing wrong
with your remote.

643
00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:55.357
<i>There's a barrier
your signal won't get through.</i>

644
00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:58.393
<i>The AR3 is an KR unit...</i>

645
00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.862
<i>that is used in banks
and government buildings.</i>

646
01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:02.998
<i>What is the application
for your trigger?</i>

647
01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.099
<i>Warehouse.</i>

648
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.701
That's interference.

649
01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:09.338
<i>You will have to be inside the LR ring,
or forget it.</i>

650
01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:12.207
<i>Unless you start from scratch
and go to a new system.</i>

651
01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.242
No, I can't do that.
Not enough time.

652
01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:19.022
Too much interference.
You <i>would</i> have to detonate inside.

653
01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.960
<i>You lost a wife
and a daughter.</i>

654
01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.962
<i>But don't forget...</i>

655
01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:29.795
<i>I lost a niece
and her little one.</i>

656
01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:34.764
<i>I don't want
to lose you too.</i>

657
01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.626
Now you know everything.

658
01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.336
No.
No, I don't.

659
01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:09.206
How come an engineer
knows so much about guns?

660
01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:12.278
Military service.
Back home.

661
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:18.082
So, what you said on the phone.
Is that your plan?

662
01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:21.388
To get everybody
into this warehouse?

663
01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.812
Yes.

664
01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.081
Alphonse is always there.

665
01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:29.188
I just need
to get the Albanians there, too.

666
01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.559
There are many men.

667
01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:36.063
But,
your bombs doesn't work.

668
01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.663
They work.

669
01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:41.742
That's one way of looking at it.

670
01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.309
Another is you don't care
if you get out of there.

671
01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:51.509
You'd rather die than fail.

672
01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:53.775
Don't worry about it.

673
01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:56.416
I'll be around long enough to do
what you asked me to do.

674
01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:59.347
I don't want you to do that.
Bring me food.

675
01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.816
My morn likes lo cook.

676
01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.718
It would
just go to waste otherwise.

677
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:08.897
I'll wedge it in between the mustard
and plastic explosives.

678
01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:12.194
You may not care
if you get out alive...

679
01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.869
but in the meantime,
you should eat.

680
01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:25.674
My rabbit's foot.

681
01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:28.713
If you don't believe in it,
I'll take it back.

682
01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.354
Bye.

683
01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.732
Delivery Confirmation

684
01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.235
Sign right here.

685
01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:00.547
Ilir.

686
01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:05.807
<i>Hello'?</i>

687
01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.809
<i>Hey, 'IVs Fonz.
Listen.</i>

688
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.477
<i>I found this lawyer.</i>

689
01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:13.081
He says he can close
financing for the uptown buildings.

690
01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:16.251
And he don't know anything
about Lon pulling out.

691
01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:18.286
<i>Is this guy clean'?</i>

692
01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.054
<i>Yeah.</i>

693
01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.455
He wants to see
the Commerce Building.

694
01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:23.258
So I'm gonna meet him
there tonight at nine.

695
01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.460
<i>What if our problem shows up?</i>

696
01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:28.465
<i>Fucking 'I don't know'
kind of shit, man.</i>

697
01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:31.044
<i>No, you're the only one that knows.</i>

698
01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.006
<i>I</i> gotta go-

699
01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:02.931
Yeah.

700
01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.775
Yo, Vic.
You with anybody?

701
01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.735
Yeah.
I'm busy.

702
01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.804
Well, drop your dick.
I found the gypsy cab.

703
01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:12.040
<i>The guy at the cab company says
he remembers Paul.</i>

704
01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:13.241
<i>Paul was there.</i>

705
01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.443
<i>I'm like a detective,
a detective, man.</i>

706
01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:18.516
Like Columbo.
I'm scaring myself.

707
01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:20.482
Vic.

708
01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:21.750
<i>1'“ be right down.</i>

709
01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.695
Right.

710
01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:37.138
Hey, Vic.

711
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.940
Vic.
This girl you're seeing.

712
01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:41.770
She your girlfriend?

713
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.738
No.
Nothing serious.

714
01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:46.274
She's got...
Her face.

715
01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.877
Yeah.
Car accident.

716
01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.779
Does it affect her?

717
01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.453
You have no idea.

718
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.920
Hey,
you never mentioned her before.

719
01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.920
You embarrassed about me?

720
01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:01.834
- Yeah, I'm embarrassed about you.
- You're embarrassed about your friends, huh?

721
01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:05.126
So?

722
01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:07.471
This is it right here.

723
01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.599
The cab
dropped off Paul right here.

724
01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.267
You're sure?

725
01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:13.401
Yeah.

726
01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:16.440
They keep a track,
drop offs, pick ups.

727
01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.849
All right, detective?
Can we leave now?

728
01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:30.988
A cemetery?

729
01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.332
That's creepy.

730
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.168
The office is closed tomorrow.
But I could call them.

731
01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.504
Maybe I'll come by
with a picture of Paul.

732
01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.906
See if anybody knows anything.

733
01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.045
All right.

734
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.182
Fuck.

735
01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.812
Come on.
I gotta get out of here.

736
01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:58.380
Everything okay?

737
01:06:58.381 --> 01:06:58.847
Yeah.

738
01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.351
I just got some business
to take care of.

739
01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.981
Come on in.

740
01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:34.145
So what did you tell Darcy?

741
01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.714
Your text said
not to tell anyone I was coming.

742
01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:41.353
I told him I was...

743
01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.760
I had something to do.

744
01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.699
Here's your food.

745
01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:03.616
I set a trap, Victor.

746
01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.745
I said whoever walks
through that door at nine o'clock...

747
01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:13.053
was going to have a real bad night.

748
01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.834
The person doing this to me...

749
01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.794
he's hurt.

750
01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:30.736
Someone who lost someone.

751
01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:35.548
Like the people in the picture.

752
01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.617
And he's in a great deal of pain
because of the...

753
01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:44.515
And it's a pain that I've caused.

754
01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:51.692
Then he kills Paul.

755
01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:56.031
And found he was in both feel.

756
01:09:57.526 --> 01:10:00.564
Victor,
I want him to know something.

757
01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:03.765
I want him to know that
if there's anything left in his world...

758
01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.939
that he still cares about.

759
01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.939
I'm going to find it.

760
01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:12.385
And I'm gonna burn it down.

761
01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:21.720
He's probably wondering right now
what I'm thinking.

762
01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:24.157
What my plan is.

763
01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.798
And how much I know.

764
01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:34.833
Wouldn't you be wondering
what I'm thinking?

765
01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.509
I would.

766
01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:50.122
You know,
you're the only one I can trust, Victor.

767
01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:52.988
You know why?

768
01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.223
No.

769
01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:59.428
Because you saved my life
at Harry's.

770
01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.366
It would be something though.

771
01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.762
If you saved my life...

772
01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:11.108
only to be the one
who kills me.

773
01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.850
Have a seal.

774
01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.925
I must stand, please.

775
01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.462
They're outside.

776
01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.159
The other day...

777
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.728
you told me
that if I helped you...

778
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:14.529
Yes!

779
01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:17.010
Believe what I say,
my friend.

780
01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.901
I don't know my boss...

781
01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.506
He will not know.

782
01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.875
You guarantee that?

783
01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:27.685
That I won't be harmed?

784
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.912
I swear to God.
Please.

785
01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:31.846
You're asking me these things...

786
01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.748
so I know
you've been thinking about it.

787
01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.023
About me in here.

788
01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.459
All right.

789
01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:44.092
Listen lo me.
You're in the city... all right?

790
01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:47.628
You're in the basement
of my boss's warehouse.

791
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:51.232
His name is Alphonse.
Alphonse Hoyt.

792
01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:54.112
I don't know what your brother
or his men did to him.

793
01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:57.874
They're gonna kill you
whether he pays or not.

794
01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:02.377
I got a camera.

795
01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.045
You can record a message
for your brother.

796
01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.753
I'll make sure he gels it.

797
01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.416
We gotta go fast.

798
01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:08.916
Thank you.

799
01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:09.851
Tell him where you are.

800
01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:11.452
It's important
to tell him where you are.

801
01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.796
I swear to you.

802
01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.335
Speak.

803
01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.934
Thank you.

804
01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.242
I promise you...

805
01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.125
We killed you.

806
01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.154
We killed you all!

807
01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:17.985
We killed you all!

808
01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:22.298
I swear on their graves,
you didn't.

809
01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:25.593
I swear!

810
01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:28.575
I swear on their graves,
you didn't!

811
01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.271
No, no, no!

812
01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:37.875
No!

813
01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:39.450
No!

814
01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.309
No, no, no!

815
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:45.680
No! Don't let me die like this!
Please!

816
01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.024
Please!

817
01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.092
Don't let me die...!

818
01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:56.201
Please have mercy!
Please!

819
01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:07.075
Don't let me die like this!
Please!

820
01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:11.399
Yeah.

821
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.967
Yo, I tracked down the manager.

822
01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:13.801
What manager?

823
01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:15.475
From the bone yard.

824
01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:17.738
I thought it was closed today.

825
01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.006
He's gonna be here in 15.

826
01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:21.375
Says he's needs to feed
some fish or some shit-.

827
01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:23.444
I can meet him alone,
if you're busy.

828
01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:25.746
No.
No, I'll be there.

829
01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.148
All right.

830
01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.355
Fuck!

831
01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:32.558
Fuck!

832
01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:52.840
I need to send this package.

833
01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.842
But I gotta take care
of something I didn't count on.--...

834
01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:57.346
so can you send it for me?

835
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.385
Yeah.

836
01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:03.851
What is it?

837
01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:05.052
You don't need to know what it is.

838
01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.828
I need to know what it is.

839
01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.059
What is it?

840
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.560
It's a video.

841
01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.729
It's one of the Albanians,
saying something I need him to say...

842
01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.564
to the person I need him to say it to.

843
01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:17.566
All right?

844
01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.806
Okay-

845
01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:23.270
You need lo gel a tracking number.

846
01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:25.251
With alerts lo my cell phone.

847
01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.381
Yeah.

848
01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:31.056
Thanks.

849
01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.729
Wait.

850
01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.558
Tell your mother
it was very good.

851
01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:45.594
Yeah?

852
01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.939
It's not too salty?

853
01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.604
No.

854
01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:51.943
It was perfect.

855
01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.892
Hey, this shit's coming together-.

856
01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.101
Paul was definitely here.

857
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360
How'd you know he was here?

858
01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.431
The manager.

859
01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.364
He asked for this.

860
01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:24.905
It's a list
of all the people buried here.

861
01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:29.440
The guy said he was interested
in the Hungarian section.

862
01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:32.751
The Hungarian section.
Did he say why?

863
01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:33.952
No.

864
01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.047
There's hundreds of them.

865
01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:56.099
What happened to that girl?

866
01:18:57.599 --> 01:19:00.808
That girl you told me
about across the way from you.

867
01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:02.472
You ever meet her?

868
01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:05.508
Yeah. I met her.

869
01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.617
And?

870
01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:17.492
You didn't die two years ago.

871
01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.597
They found the cemetery.

872
01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:33.277
They're getting close.

873
01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.877
The one
who found you before got lucky.

874
01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:45.246
And just because
he found the grave...

875
01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:48.524
doesn't mean
that they will figure it out as well.

876
01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.687
You can walk away still.

877
01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.794
Not loo late.

878
01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:59.660
I know why
you've been wailing so long.

879
01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:02.164
Why you haven't killed him.

880
01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:07.009
I think you're afraid
that when it's over...

881
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:10.115
it won't mend your heart.

882
01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:38.999
It was going lo waste.

883
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.504
I just felt like putting it on.

884
01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:54.849
<i>- Okay, lets go.
- Hey, monster!</i>

885
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.056
Hey!

886
01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.575
What happened?

887
01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.211
I fall.

888
01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.074
And ruined a nice dress.

889
01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:21.452
Let's see.

890
01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.717
You okay?

891
01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:31.322
At least
it wasn't on my good side.

892
01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.891
I sent your package.

893
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.236
I have your tracking number.

894
01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.061
Thank you.

895
01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:42.162
Hello, Victor.

896
01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:42.868
Hello.

897
01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.976
Thank you
for returning my Tupperware.

898
01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:57.077
Of course.

899
01:21:57.078 --> 01:22:01.615
People usually don't.
Like it comes with the food.

900
01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.493
Free Tupperware.

901
01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:06.453
Did you like the food?

902
01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:09.723
Yeah.
The food was... very good.

903
01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.458
Beatrice didn't tell you?

904
01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:14.440
She was nervous
you wouldn't like her cooking.

905
01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.802
I always told her...

906
01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:25.012
the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

907
01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.842
Well all the way.

908
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.250
She'll keep you well fed.
That's for sure.

909
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:46.593
You know, this thing..-
me falling and hitting my head?

910
01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:50.974
Maybe it happened
because I lost my rabbit's foot.

911
01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.738
The truth is my morn gave it to me
after the accident-.

912
01:22:57.739 --> 01:23:01.346
She said it was going to bring me luck
with my procedures.

913
01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:05.112
I picked the color.

914
01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.115
Stupid chartreuse.

915
01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.863
<i>HEY-</i>

916
01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:21.835
Would you go out
with me tonight?

917
01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.713
Somewhere.

918
01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.647
Anywhere.

919
01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:32.516
Yeah.

920
01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.276
Okay-

921
01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.365
Yeah.

922
01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:33.004
<i>Laszlo Kerik.</i>

923
01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.911
Laszlo Kerik?
Do you know the name?

924
01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.141
No.
No, I don't know him.

925
01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.242
I didn't think you would.

926
01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:46.046
I've been searching every dead
Hungarian on this cemetery list.

927
01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:49.950
This went down nine months
before we were on the crew.

928
01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:53.020
<i>There was a court</i> case
<i>involving Alphonse and</i> a <i>little girl...</i>

929
01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.656
<i>who was killed
in one of his buildings.</i>

930
01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.891
<i>The case never went to trial.
Get this, right?</i>

931
01:24:57.892 --> 01:25:00.127
The little girl's
mommy and daddy...

932
01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:01.662
They died
like two months afterwards.

933
01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:03.939
They're buried
right there next lo her.

934
01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.142
<i>Vic?</i>

935
01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:11.741
You there?
Vic?

936
01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:13.442
<i>Vic?</i>

937
01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:14.975
Yeah. I'm here.

938
01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:15.909
<i>I did it, man.</i>

939
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.478
I fucking did it.

940
01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:20.447
I found out exactly
what Paul must have found out.

941
01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:23.383
<i>I want to tell Alphonse.
I want you to he there when I tell him.</i>

942
01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.252
<i>Can you get there?</i>

943
01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:28.325
No, I'm in the middle of something.
I'll talk to you later.

944
01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:57.251
Oh, Victor.

945
01:25:57.252 --> 01:26:00.721
I didn't know you were coming.
I would have thrown something on.

946
01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:02.929
Maman,
you knew very well he was coming.

947
01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:05.569
Well, I told you so.

948
01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:09.736
Ready?

949
01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.910
So...uh...

950
01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:22.676
Where are we going?

951
01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:23.917
You'll see.

952
01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:28.083
A club?

953
01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:30.118
Very cold.

954
01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.264
A Park?

955
01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.827
Are you okay?

956
01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:43.001
Yeah.
Good.

957
01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.048
This is...

958
01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:01.925
The bar.

959
01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:05.419
In his house,
some credit card receipts.

960
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.321
He usually leaves the bar
at 8:30 every night.

961
01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.855
He look a trip.

962
01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.857
I want lo make sure he's back.

963
01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:14.135
If he's here tonight,
he'll probably be here tomorrow night.

964
01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.610
I'm prepared to do it then.

965
01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.520
L-q-

966
01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:41.227
I've found a moment... with you.

967
01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:47.630
I want lo hang onto it.

968
01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:53.771
It's not gonna end up that way.

969
01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:00.112
I never said it would.

970
01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.421
Not with words.

971
01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.530
I wore that white dress for you.

972
01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:19.069
Was that a mistake?

973
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.347
Yes.

974
01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.917
Wail here.

975
01:28:43.918 --> 01:28:45.659
I'll be back in a minute.

976
01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:01.396
What did you do?

977
01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:03.204
Here.

978
01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.108
It's done.

979
01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:09.409
It's done.

980
01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.173
Nope.

981
01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:23.052
Hold up.
Oh, it's this one.

982
01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:28.081
So you're saying
it's someone who knew them?

983
01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.749
He must have.

984
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.696
Cause this guy's dead, right?

985
01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.464
Right?

986
01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:41.104
What is it?

987
01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:45.276
The little girl died June 17th.

988
01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:47.476
Two years ago. Right?

989
01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:49.874
Yeah.

990
01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:53.213
June 17th is tomorrow.

991
01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.882
Beatrice!

992
01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:30.147
What are you doing?

993
01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.088
Huh?

994
01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.317
0h, my God!

995
01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:37.984
Beatrice.

996
01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:40.487
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

997
01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:43.367
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

998
01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.940
Yeah,
I'm walking back to him now.

999
01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:00.976
Okay-

1000
01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:08.081
Yeah.

1001
01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:10.083
<i>Hey, you know who this is?
Right?</i>

1002
01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.685
Yeah, I know who it is.

1003
01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:15.188
I've been getting these weird letters
for the past three months.

1004
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:17.424
With pictures?
With the eyes crossed out?

1005
01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.836
<i>We been getting them too.</i>

1006
01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:21.270
Whoever is doing it took my brother.

1007
01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:28.773
You remember this...

1008
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.444
problem I had
you take care of for me?

1009
01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.311
<i>Hungarian Rhapsody?</i>

1010
01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:37.978
You stayed lo the finale.
Right?

1011
01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.151
Yeah.

1012
01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:42.115
<i>The whole family took a bow?</i>

1013
01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:43.249
Yeah.

1014
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:46.459
And you're sure
you saw the father take a bow?

1015
01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:51.658
<i>Where the fuck have you been?
We been trying to call you.</i>

1016
01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:52.993
My car won't start.

1017
01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.961
Some shit's going down, man.

1018
01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:55.895
<i>The fucking thing won't start.</i>

1019
01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.705
What am I gonna tell you?

1020
01:33:58.499 --> 01:33:59.432
Come pick me up.

1021
01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:00.878
What?

1022
01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.532
Ilir...?

1023
01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:26.497
Brozi?

1024
01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:27.834
Here?

1025
01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.781
Delivery Confirmation

1026
01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:59.456
he is still alive
Maybe more moments - Laszlo

1027
01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:24.822
Vic!

1028
01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.283
You didn't mail the package.

1029
01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:04.820
You didn't kill him-.

1030
01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:09.729
You didn't kill him
because you feel something for me.

1031
01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:13.226
You knew how I would feel.

1032
01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:14.694
You didn't mail
the package.

1033
01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:16.229
I tried.

1034
01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:19.666
And the guy walked away,
and I called him back.

1035
01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:23.843
I called him back,
because I feel something for you.

1036
01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:30.450
I could love you.

1037
01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:37.851
I don't want you to die.

1038
01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:42.155
So I thought if I could just mess up
one of your things, just one thing...

1039
01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:45.831
it would be enough
so it wouldn't work out the way you planned.

1040
01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:52.066
So I put my rabbit's foot
in that package.

1041
01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:55.245
And I took
the video card out.

1042
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.783
They got
my rabbit's foot instead.

1043
01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.121
We can run away.

1044
01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.448
They'd find us.

1045
01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:09.951
We'd keep on running.

1046
01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:14.189
We'd travel by night.
I don't care how far we have to go.

1047
01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:16.199
Vic?

1048
01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:19.832
What.._? Shit.-.

1049
01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:23.160
Laszlo.

1050
01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.558
Fucking Laszlo.

1051
01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.505
I'm gonna wail for you here.

1052
01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.262
Where are you?

1053
01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:31.531
I'm outside your apartment.
Come back. Please.

1054
01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.766
Beatrice,
I want you to go to your apartment now.

1055
01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:34.400
Go there now...

1056
01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:36.642
and slay there and wait for me.
Okay.

1057
01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:41.075
Come back!

1058
01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:45.778
If you fucking scream,
it will go bad!

1059
01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:46.553
Okay?

1060
01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:47.889
<i>Okay?</i>

1061
01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:54.520
Laszlo fucking Kerik.

1062
01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.856
<i>You made me a douche,
Laszlo Kerik.</i>

1063
01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.491
<i>I've seen your artwork.</i>

1064
01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:00.760
I've seen your fucking pictures.

1065
01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:02.762
You put Paul in the freezer.

1066
01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.764
This has nothing to do with you.

1067
01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:06.532
I sent you
to my apartment to save you.

1068
01:40:06.533 --> 01:40:07.333
All right.

1069
01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.234
You weren't supposed to go inside.

1070
01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:10.303
Yeah, but I did go inside.

1071
01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:12.338
I was worried about you.

1072
01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:14.107
I don't want to fucking kill you.

1073
01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:16.909
Take this opportunity,
and you let her go.

1074
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.211
You lied to me.

1075
01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:19.979
You fucking lied to me.

1076
01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:22.315
The godfather of my son.

1077
01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:24.384
Let her go. Let her go-.

1078
01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:25.551
You listen to me.

1079
01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.820
You get in your shitty car
that does start.

1080
01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.389
You start your shitty car.

1081
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:32.325
And you drive
your shitty car to Alphonse's.

1082
01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:33.960
We'll be waiting.

1083
01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:35.338
Fuck.

1084
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.032
Get up!

1085
01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:51.823
What does it mean?

1086
01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.160
Darcy's here with the girl.

1087
01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:14.133
What happened to your face?

1088
01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:15.468
Car accident.

1089
01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:17.244
What happened to yours?

1090
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.448
You motherfuckers.

1091
01:42:06.386 --> 01:42:07.520
Victor.

1092
01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:09.899
Alphonse.
Don't go anywhere.

1093
01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:11.864
Are you coming for me?

1094
01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:13.870
No.
I'm coming for her.

1095
01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:17.135
Yeah, well,
she won't be here when you gel here.

1096
01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:53.598
Take her to my room!

1097
01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:11.252
And don't fucking move!

1098
01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:30.663
Motherfucker!

1099

He just shot Loco.

1100
01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.273
No, look!
He's coming up the back stairs.

1101
01:45:10.704 --> 01:45:15.346
All right now!

1102

Down the fucking stairs!

1103
01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.753
Hey, Victor!

1104
01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:29.722
Remember I told you
if there was anything left.-.

1105
01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:32.725

1106
01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:35.570
and I was gonna burn
that shit down.

1107
01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:40.336
How about this?
Huh?

1108
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:53.013
You ain't there,
