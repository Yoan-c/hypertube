00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.072
Fellas, it's go time.

2
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.516
Turtle Formation in three, two, one!

3
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.677
What happened to Turtle Formation?

4
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.113
Turtle Formation?

5
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.350
I thought you said "Squirrel Formation."

6
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.432
Why would he say "Squirrel..."
What's "Squirrel Formation"?

7
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.000
Guys, chill out. Let's go!

8
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.674
Hey, Raph, do that thing.

9
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.856
Oh, no. I don't want to do it. It hurts.

10
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.313
Do it, do it, do it...

11
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.040
Won't stop until you do it, do it, do it.

12
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.634
Okay, fine!

13
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.358
Whoo-whoo!

14
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.149
Yeah!

15
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.868
Yeah!

16
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040
Whoo!

17
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.192
- Donnie!
- Here we go!

18
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.879
You set it up, right?

19
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.712
Yeah,
he'll be there, I promise.

20
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.480
Thanks, Kevin. See you next week!

21
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.433
Go, go, go!

22
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.390
Guys, you know the drill.
Let's get that box from Mikey.

23
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520
Give me that.

24
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.276
- Over here! Whoa!
- Keep away!

25
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.079
Raph, over here!

26
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.268
Right back at you.

27
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.958
- I'll take that.
- Hey!

28
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120
Whoo!

29
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.400
All right, guys.
We made it just in time!

30
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.118
You see that?

31
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.376
All right,
I say, "Go!" You say, "Knicks!"

32
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.152
- Go! Go!
- Knicks! Knicks!

33
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.416
Two points coming up!

34
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.800
Shoot it! Shoot the ball!

35
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.951
Oh, guys, does it get
any better than this?

36
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.076
Yeah, but I want to be down there.

37
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.673
You sit your ugly self down there,

38
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.256
you'd have people running for their lives.

39
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.236
You see me? I look good, brah.

40
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.918
Yo, fellas! Hey, hey, hey.

41
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.776
We got the best seats
in the house right here.

42
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.915
Anyone can sit down there.

43
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.274
We saved this city.

44
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.749
We should be on
the Jumbotron, not in it.

45
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.136
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

46
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.390
<i>one year ago,
a shadow fell over our city.</i>

47
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.879
<i>Suddenly, it was under siege
by the notorious villain, Shredder.</i>

48
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.312
<i>Along with his army of enforcers,
the Foot Clan,</i>

49
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.795
<i>Shredder ruled our streets.</i>

50
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
<i>Until one day,</i>

51
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.396
<i>from out of the shadows,
stepped a beacon of hope.</i>

52
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.471
Hey, you see who that is?

53
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.716
<i>He was just a humble cameraman.</i>

54
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.155
<i>But when danger struck
the heart of our city,</i>

55
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.358
<i>he single-handedly battled Shredder,
locking him up behind bars.</i>

56
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.032
<i>And now, turn your attention courtside</i>

57
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.918
<i>where Jill Martin meets
a man who, later this week,</i>

58
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.309
<i>will receive an honorary key to the city.</i>

59
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.479
<i>Please welcome
Vern "The Falcon" Fenwick!</i>

60
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.115
<i>Vern,</i>

61
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.556
<i>tell the fans how
a regular New Yorker like yourself</i>

62
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.437
<i>was able to single-handedly</i>

63
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.511
<i>hunt Shredder down
and bring him to justice.</i>

64
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.194
<i>Well, the truth is, Jill,</i>

65
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.754
<i>I actually had help
from a couple of friends.</i>

66
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.629
No way!
He's total ly gon na give us props.

67
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.199
Here it comes! Ooh, here it comes!

68
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.035
<i>Thunder and Lightning!</i>

69
00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.155
<i>Yeah!</i>

70
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.199
- Aw, come on!
- What is this?

71
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.336
Guys, you know we couldn't take credit
for bringing down Shredder.

72
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.296
Vern's just sticking
to the arrangement we made with him.

73
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.469
Yeah, well,

74
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.536
this arrangement has
us spending the rest of our lives

75
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.754
sitting in the nosebleeds.

76
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.352
Speaking of nosebleeds...

77
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.480
- Hey, what'd you take?
- Hold on. Hold on.

78
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.216
Hey, be careful with that,
that's my peashooter.

79
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.000
Okay, hold on.
Head shot. Straight head shot.

80
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.149
Oh, you got this.

81
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.600
You got this! Yeah.

82
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.912
<i>So I just wanted to be
an example for all New Yorkers.</i>

83
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.629
<i>One man...</i>

84
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.834
Yo, you got him!

85
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.191
<i>Are you... Are you okay?</i>

86
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.109
<i>Yeah.</i>

87
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.256
Oh, my turn, my turn, my turn.

88
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.872
All right. All right. You got this.

89
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.997
<i>Okay. Thanks so much for joining us.</i>

90
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.638
<i>Vern "The Falcon" Fenwick, everybody!</i>

91
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.631
Take that, Falcon!

92
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.199
What happened out there?

93
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.829
Hey, April.

94
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.598
April! Hey! What's up, April?

95
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.256
Oh, nothing, I've been working out.

96
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.520
<i>Donnie, listen to me.
I'm at Grand Central Station</i>

97
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.471
staking out Dr. Baxter Stockman.

98
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.776
<i>Oh, Baxter Stockman!</i>

99
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.758
He graduated MIT at 15.
He's got 134 patents.

100
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.070
<i>He's the lead scientist for TCRI.</i>

101
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.957
<i>Big fan. The man's a genius.</i>

102
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.656
Yeah, well, he's a genius
that's about to be in a lot of trouble.

103
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.114
<i>Look, I think Baxter Stockman
is working with Shredder.</i>

104
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.037
Shredder. Do you need us there?

105
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.076
Nah. Baxter is a softie.

106
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.637
Oh, but, you know, that, uh,
birthday present that you made for me?

107
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.869
The watch, yeah.

108
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.235
I want to use it
to try and hack into Baxter's emails.

109
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.616
Okay, April, but if you're going to
hack into his accounts,

110
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.709
you'll need to get close.

111
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.869
<i>How close?</i>

112
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.235
Your watch needs to be
within three feet of his device,

113
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.719
iPad, iPhone, whatever.

114
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.597
Got it. Good looking out, buddy.

115
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.479
Talk to you soon.

116
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.113
Here you are, sir.

117
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.200
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

118
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.319
Excuse me.

119
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.829
Um, sorry. It's just... Aren't you...

120
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.656
As much as I'd like to be someone
that a girl like you would recognize,

121
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.035
I can assure you
you don't know who I am.

122
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.674
You're Baxter Stockman. PhD.

123
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.634
Graduated from MIT at 15 years old.

124
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.676
Your innovations in nanorobotics at TCRI

125
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.274
have been truly inspirational for me.

126
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.635
I'm so sorry. I'm just like... I'm a nerd!

127
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.756
No, please. Geek out. Please.

128
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.239
- Really?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.435
Oh.

130
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.953
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

131
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.816
Um, actually, though,
there's a big difference.

132
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.796
I'm a nerd, not a geek.

133
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.320
Um, it's the difference between, like,
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Harry Potter.</i>

134
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.238
- Oh!
- Or, um, TED Talks and...

135
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.517
Comic-Con! Yeah.

136
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.279
- Wow.
- Yeah.

137
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.790
Dr. Stockman.
We just got confirmation, sir.

138
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.997
The "package" is shipping later tonight.

139
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.754
Well, make sure
they're tracking it every step of the way.

140
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.308
And Trevor, I'm done working for the day.

141
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.696
I just have to take this.
Really quick. It's my boyfriend. I'm sorry.

142
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.233
Oh, you have a boyfriend.

143
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.151
Of course you do.
But does your boyfriend know

144
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.674
the difference
between pi to the third decimal point,

145
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.910
and pi to the fifteenth decimal point?

146
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.752
It has truly been an honor to meet you.

147
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.559
And you are really one of the greatest
minds of our generation.

148
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.755
Bye.

149
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.313
Look, everybody. I got a cowboy.

150
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.078
Look at those muscles, am I right? Wow.

151
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.829
Cheese!

152
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.715
There's so many of you.

153
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.152
Defense! Defense! Defense!

154
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.954
Jump ball!

155
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.112
Jump ball! No way!
It's pizza on my Nike! It's pizza!

156
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.519
Look at it. Look at my shoe.

157
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.591
Explain that to me. It's pizza on my Nike!

158
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.199
Hey, man, welcome to New York.

159
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.713
That was a close call.

160
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.896
We're gonna
have to find a new spot

161
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.433
to watch the game now, Mikey.

162
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.075
Mikey!

163
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.998
Mikey, what are you doing?

164
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.638
It's the Halloween parade, bro.

165
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.188
I always wanted to be
in the Halloween parade.

166
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.635
It's the one night
of the year where we fit in.

167
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.789
Mikey, we'll never fit in.

168
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.633
We're ninjas.
We live in the shadows. Let's go!

169
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.237
Yeah. Let's go.

170
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.434
Cool.

171
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440
Looking good, bro.

172
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.914
Whoa!

173
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.995
Thanks, man.

174
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.280
Mikey.

175
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.316
- Mikey.
- What's the problem?

176
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.516
This is my city. These are my people!

177
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.995
Is New York in the house?

178
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
Whoo!

179
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.832
That was the most amazing thing ever!

180
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.831
What part of
"ninjas move in the shadows"

181
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.876
don't you understand?

182
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.188
April! How'd it go?

183
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.280
Donnie, I'm looking at the data
from Baxter's iPad.

184
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.117
<i>Hey, you got in. What did you find?</i>

185
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.195
Hold on, Donnie. The files are erasing.

186
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.032
It's some sort of self-destruct program.

187
00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.155
Erasing?

188
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.389
<i>Before they started erasing</i>

189
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.096
<i>I had a chance to read
a couple of Baxter's emails,</i>

190
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.235
<i>and I was right.</i>

191
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.437
Baxter is working with the Foot Clan.

192
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.149
Shredder is being transported to a prison
in upstate New York tonight.

193
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.360
And the Foot Clan
are planning on hitting the convoy.

194
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.230
They're gonna break him
out of police custody.

195
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.958
He'll be free again!

196
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.629
Who, Donnie?

197
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.319
Shredder.

198
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.909
Beebs.

199
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.155
Oh, okay.

200
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.679
Hey, Jones.

201
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.669
They're all yours.

202
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.591
What up, Big Daddy Law Breaker?

203
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.597
On behalf of the people of New York,
welcome to The Big Good-bye.

204
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.873
<i>You have meditated for nearly 24 hours.</i>

205
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.437
<i>In ten seconds you will reach nirvana</i>

206
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.512
<i>and total spiritual enlightenment.</i>

207
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.712
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

208
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.272
<i>- Three, two...</i>
- Hmm?

209
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.349
Excuse me. All right, slow down.

210
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.040
Does somebody want to explain?

211
00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.833
Sensei, the Foot Clan are attempting

212
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.433
to break Shredder out of custody.

213
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.030
If Shredder is free,

214
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.078
his reign of terror
over the city will begin again.

215
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.280
Exactly.

216
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.356
Then there's only one question.

217
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.950
Why are you wasting time
talking to a grumpy old rat?

218
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.878
Go get him!

219
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.829
Thanks, Dad.

220
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.879
Okay, guys, don't get too excited.

221
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.439
It's still a work in progress.

222
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.478
Oh!

223
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.239
Dude!

224
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.149
Oh, whoa! Are you kidding me?

225
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.120
I'm telling you guys,
a lot of tweaking still required.

226
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.240
But when it's done,
it's gonna be amazing.

227
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.118
Well, no time like the present.

228
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.456
<i>All these wires
are still bunched up here.</i>

229
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.311
<i>There's no organization to any of this.</i>

230
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.356
<i>I've got red wires, yellow wires...</i>

231
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.440
As you can see,
the spot welding's not done yet...

232
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.296
- The seats don't recline...
- Donnie! Donnie!

233
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.355
Oh.

234
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.032
All right, Shredder's convoy
is 7.2 miles east-northeast.

235
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.155
Punch it!

236
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.440
They moved the timeline up.

237
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.752
Here we go.
Sensei Shredder's on the move.

238
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.239
Surveillance feed is live.

239
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.958
Standard transport formation.

240
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.040
These guys are so predictable.

241
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.354
Hey, Shredder!

242
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.474
You got 32 counts
of first-degree murder.

243
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.158
Hot damn!

244
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.670
You are one mean son of a bitch.

245
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.856
And take it from someone
who has his own problems

246
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.438
with anger management issues,

247
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.193
you, my friend, seriously need a hobby.

248
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.511
I myself am a hockey guy.

249
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.839
I like my bone crushing on ice.

250
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.273
You like hockey, right?

251
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.390
No. I like cage fighting.

252
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.033
Cage fighting. Okay.

253
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.475
It's him.

254
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.835
Hey, hey, hey, speak from your heart.

255
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.708
Hey, Mr. Shredder.

256
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.475
Big fan of your work.
Especially your early stuff.

257
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.991
My name is Bebop. This is Rocksteady.

258
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.513
I know it's a crazy name, right,

259
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.318
but his ancestors are from Finland.

260
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.550
Yeah, that's right. I'm Finnish.

261
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.478
Because when I start a beatdown,

262
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.913
I always "finish" it!

263
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.070
- What? Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I said it!

264
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.309
- I said it!
- My man!

265
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.753
- My man!
- Give me that foot.

266
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.154
Yeah!

267
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.991
Hey! Shut up back there.

268
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.314
World works in mysterious ways,
don't it, Shredder?

269
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.318
Now you get to spend
the rest of your life behind bars

270
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.753
with these two knuckleheads.

271
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920
Or not.

272
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.758
Hey. Check those bikes.

273
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.720
Coming up on our right and our left.

274
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.513
Pin it! Pin it! Come on, man, go, go, go!

275
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.835
Oh, my God.

276
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960
Whoa!

277
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

278
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.916
- Get us some help!
- 10-13. 10-13.

279
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.831
We are being ambushed,
heading north on 87.

280
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.069
We need immediate backup!

281
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.753
Make sure that gate is bolted.

282
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.074
Shotgun!

283
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.757
- Where are the shells?
- They're in the bag.

284
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.592
What the hell are they doing in the bag?

285
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.199
Oh! The roof is on fire!

286
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.880
Are you kidding me?

287
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.555
You send us on a highway

288
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.830
with the most dangerous criminal
on the planet,

289
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.353
and you don't load the shotgun!

290
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.111
We got bogies on the bus.

291
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.856
- Let's light 'em up.
- Okay. Hit the button.

292
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.155
What button? What button?
There are a million buttons.

293
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.280
- Number three. Number three.
- Three, three, three.

294
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360
Oh!

295
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.920
We got company.
Mikey, clear our right flank.

296
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.555
Nunchuks giganticus. Whoa!

297
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.280
Say hello to my little friend.

298
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.392
Good job, Mikey.

299
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.630
Those things are pretty awesome, huh?

300
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.591
Yeah, pretty awesome!

301
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.909
Eh...

302
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.716
Get them out of there!
Eliminate those turtles!

303
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680
Oh...

304
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.353
I don't like those guys.

305
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.960
I'm not being used
to my full potential here, Leo.

306
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.792
Hey, just chill, Raph. We're a little busy.

307
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.951
Uh, guys, they're coming back.

308
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.998
Enough! It's time to take out the trash.

309
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.839
That's how I roll.

310
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.919
That's how you roll.

311
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Whoo!

312
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.478
Anything else I can do for you?

313
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.315
Raider 3, move in. Move in.
Get him to the extraction point.

314
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840
Oh...

315
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.276
We are two miles from Exit 14.
Set up an intercept.

316
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.148
- What is that thing?
- It's a big-ass magnet.

317
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040
Whoa!

318
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.480
Now we're talking!

319
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.518
Get back there. Secure the prisoners.

320
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.719
Shredder!

321
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.708
Shit!

322
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.711
- He's getting away!
- No, he's not.

323
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.109
Yeah!

324
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.816
If Sensei Shredder
can't make it to the extraction point,

325
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.990
then we bring the extraction point to him.

326
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.816
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Don't rush me! Don't rush me!

327
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.840
Yeah!

328
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.114
Hey. My name is Be-bop!

329
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.549
Hi.

330
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.077
Okay. It's all you, Mikey.

331
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.593
Time to shine.

332
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440
Ow! Ow!

333
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960
I'm sorry!

334
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.832
- It's stuck.
- Oh, this sucks.

335
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.119
- Oh, there it is.
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

336
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.517
This is awesome!

337
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.416
We have to teleport Shredder earlier.

338
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.555
But you said...

339
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.234
Yes, that that would be
irresponsibly dangerous. True.

340
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.280
All right, Donnie,
you've got to get Mikey closer.

341
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.953
Locking on.

342
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.429
One shot is all you got.

343
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200
Initiate.

344
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.793
Take the shot, Mikey!

345
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.593
Where'd he go?

346
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.039
It worked!

347
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.789
But... Shredder's location unknown?

348
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.835
Where am I?

349
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.992
Does it matter?

350
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.275
I know what you're thinking right now.

351
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.352
Of all the ways you'd like to kill me.

352
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.193
But that would require
you outthinking me.

353
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.353
And no one, no thing
is smarter than the Krang!

354
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.959
Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.033
Did I get a little tentacle mucus
in your eyes, Shredder?

356
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.080
So you know my name.

357
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.071
Why am I here?

358
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.435
Because you
and your buddy Dr. Stockman

359
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.909
found something of mine.

360
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.036
The teleportation device.

361
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.391
The teleport was
supposed to break me out of prison.

362
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.958
But it is capable
of so much more.

363
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.871
That device is part of a machine

364
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.837
called the arc capacitor.

365
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.791
Years ago, I launched
the arc capacitor to Earth's dimension.

366
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.110
But upon entering your atmosphere,

367
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.509
it broke apart into three pieces.

368
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.550
You and Stockman have one piece.

369
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.275
Another is in a museum in New York.

370
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.238
The third is in the Brazilian rainforest.

371
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.392
Collect the other two pieces.

372
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.391
Dr. Stockman should
be inventive enough

373
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.075
to reassemble the arc capacitor.

374
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.559
And then what?

375
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.959
It will open a portal

376
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.031
through which
I can bring my war machine,

377
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.918
the Technodrome, to Earth.

378
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.350
Together, we can bring
the people of your planet to their knees.

379
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.439
I'm interested.

380
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.360
I will help you take down planet Earth

381
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.954
if you help me with my problem.

382
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.957
Four brothers will try to stop me.

383
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.559
Turtles.

384
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.676
I'm aware of your past.

385
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.632
Take this.

386
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.872
It will solve
all your problems with those pests.

387
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.115
I'll see you on the other side.

388
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.157
Push me back in!

389
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.996
Push me in, you stupid robot.

390
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.119
More!

391
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.199
You idiot!

392
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.616
Okay, so he just vanished?

393
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.760
Wait, wait, wait.

394
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.440
If I run the video
from my shoulder camera

395
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.616
through an electrostatic filter,

396
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.313
we might be able to see
what happened to Shredder.

397
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.197
Come on. Show me something, buddy.

398
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.633
Look! Right there!

399
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.276
It appears to be some kind of
residue from a teleportation event.

400
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.876
Yeah, teleportation event residue, man.
It's the worst.

401
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.155
Does that kind of technology even exist?

402
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.800
Baxter Stockman's been
working on this kind of tech for years.

403
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.576
All of that stuff
that I pulled off of his iPad,

404
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.816
it was full of information
about Shredder and the Foot Clan.

405
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.080
It was like a virtual playbook!

406
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.995
Baxter has to have a backup.
And I bet it's on the mainframe at TCRI.

407
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.919
Donnie, I need something.
What do you got?

408
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.194
Wait.

409
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.080
I know exactly what you need.

410
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.148
Totally plug-and-play.

411
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.436
Perfect. I'll go check it out.

412
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.357
We'll go with. Operate in support.

413
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.199
Wait.

414
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.433
The sun's coming up.

415
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.593
You can't go outside. You'll be seen.

416
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.336
<i>The notorious
criminal known as Shredder</i>

417
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.800
<i>escaped police custody last night...</i>

418
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.376
<i>He was being
transported from Lower Manhattan</i>

419
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.816
<i>where he was serving a life sentence...</i>

420
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.536
<i>There's a
statewide manhunt in progress,</i>

421
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.616
<i>with the police chief saying</i>

422
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.756
<i>he will stop at nothing
to capture the fugitive.</i>

423
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Unbelievable.

424
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.273
Widen the search radius to 200 miles
on all bridges and ports.

425
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.069
And I want hourly updates from
Homeland Security and Border Patrol.

426
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.037
Make it on the half hour.

427
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.315
Excuse me?

428
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.038
This is my investigation now.

429
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.156
Bureau Chief Vincent. Organized Crime.

430
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.798
I have jurisdictional authority.

431
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.518
You forfeited jurisdiction.

432
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.320
And you proved
to be an authority on nothing

433
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.830
when you lost
three convicted felons in one night!

434
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.593
Shredder's the most notorious criminal
this city has ever seen.

435
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.033
And we had him!

436
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.151
Now he's out there.

437
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.710
And where did you recover
this highly secured vehicle?

438
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.909
Found it under the G.W. Bridge,
abandoned and stripped.

439
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.349
Any witnesses?

440
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.152
Unfortunately.

441
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.936
Everything's normal,
I'm following procedure,

442
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.999
and the next thing I know,
ninjas on motorcycles just...

443
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.514
They come zipping past!

444
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.313
And they're coming at us
from every possible direction.

445
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.119
- Keep going.
- Okay. Uh...

446
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.795
I look at my side view

447
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.030
and I see what has to be
a giant garbage truck

448
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.237
that is just barreling towards
us like it is on a warpath.

449
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.736
And what was
the objective of this

450
00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.398
battle-hungry sanitation vehicle?

451
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.816
See, I'm wondering
the same thing myself.

452
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.229
But then it starts
launching manhole covers

453
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.356
right from the grille of the truck.

454
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.909
Manhole covers!

455
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.793
Yeah, manhole covers.
As guided projectiles.

456
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.838
You're taking some time off, Jones.

457
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.598
I'm pulling you off the payroll.

458
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.671
Hey, I'm not crazy! I know what I saw!

459
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.320
Look, I can help you catch these guys.

460
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.920
I'm from New York.
I know these streets better than anyone.

461
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.877
First rule of tracking fugitives:

462
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.016
Don't take help from someone

463
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.696
who's responsible
for losing them in the first place.

464
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.233
We were ambushed!

465
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.559
Thanks for your statement, Jones.

466
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.789
That's Officer Jones!

467
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.036
And I'm gonna be a detective someday.

468
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.598
I'm just waiting for the next round

469
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.193
of applications at the academy.

470
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.593
Good luck with that.

471
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.349
As for now, do yourself a favor.

472
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.590
Leave this manhunt to the professionals.

473
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.754
So you two idiots have a favorite bar.

474
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.838
Yeah, they're not gonna be
stupid enough to go back there.

475
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.193
Yeah, they are.

476
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.998
Man, I really
rattled that prison guard's noggin good.

477
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.513
Did you see that head butt connect?

478
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.149
See it? I felt it,
I heard it, echoing off the walls!

479
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.436
- My man!
- My man!

480
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.555
Oh!

481
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.433
Just like Mama used to make.

482
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.471
Oi, barkeep! Where are those sammies?

483
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.871
Here you go, guys. House special.

484
00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.080
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's about time.

485
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.696
And a side of pickles.

486
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.320
And are these
pickles untraceable?

487
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.959
Those phones are harder to track

488
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.393
than Shredder himself, homeboy.

489
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.714
Hey, do not make eye contact with us.

490
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.038
He think we somethin' to play with.

491
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.594
You know, Beebs,

492
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.075
I'm tired of being
someone else's errand boy.

493
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.472
With Shredder out of the picture,
maybe we could step up.

494
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.910
Carve out our own piece of the city.

495
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.513
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

496
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.040
Maybe even start our own Foot Clan.

497
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.240
Eventually work
our way up to our own Leg Clan!

498
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.834
I mean, honestly, how hard could it be?

499
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.069
Hey!

500
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.071
Mr. Shredder! My man.

501
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.193
Coincidentally, we were
just contemplating a consolidation

502
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.191
of our criminal enterprises.

503
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.271
We were thinking like a

504
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.192
51/49 split.

505
00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.079
Leaning your way, of course.

506
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.718
He's not looking for partners.

507
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.671
I'm looking for errand boys.

508
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.271
Well, we could work with that.

509
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.997
Oh, wassup, drone?

510
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.633
I ain't scared of you.

511
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.109
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

512
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.279
Every second we're down here,

513
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.113
Shredder gets more
powerful and Mikey gets more annoying.

514
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.480
Hey, I heard that!

515
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.595
We're training.

516
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.109
Sort of.

517
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.519
As soon as the sun goes down,
it's turtle time.

518
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.716
Hi, drone. You talkin' to me?

519
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.076
'Cause I don't see anybody else...

520
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.196
I failed, Master Splinter.

521
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.074
You put me in charge, and Shredder
slipped through our fingers.

522
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.989
There's nothing
you could have done to stop it.

523
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.993
Do not let this setback distract you.

524
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.199
Remember,

525
00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.915
as long as you keep the team unified,
you shall always succeed.

526
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.320
<i>We're asking anyone with information</i>

527
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.680
<i>about the fugitives' whereabouts,</i>

528
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.836
<i>to please pass it along to authorities...</i>

529
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.514
I just want to ask you one more ti me.

530
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.840
Are you sure those guys
didn't come through here?

531
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.593
Hey, pal, I don't know
what you're talking about.

532
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.515
Okay.

533
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.394
You know what? I love this song!

534
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.400
You don't mind if I borrow this, do you?

535
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.159
Hey, whoa... What are you doing?

536
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.798
Nah, you know what? Never mind.

537
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.915
It has a scratch on it.

538
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Damn it!

539
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.160
Or maybe I'll have a drink.

540
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.077
- Are you out of your mind?
- Getting there.

541
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.355
Hey!

542
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.159
Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it, okay?

543
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.958
You ready to tell me where they are?

544
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.031
I slipped them cell phones.
That's all I know!

545
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.396
And I imagine a responsible
businessperson such as yourself,

546
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.198
wouldn't sell hardware without a means

547
00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.872
by which to track said hardware.

548
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.712
- Am I right?
- Look! Here.

549
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.156
I have a GPS, okay?
You'll find them with that.

550
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.639
Where are you?

551
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.196
Where did it spit you out?

552
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.519
Sensei Shredder.

553
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.919
The escape plan, it worked!

554
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.433
But not in the way you planned.

555
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.073
I've traveled very far, and now...

556
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.671
We have work to do.

557
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.757
<i>Neustedder, come in.</i>

558
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.549
<i>Neustedder?</i>

559
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.312
<i>Neustedder, do you copy?</i>

560
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.793
When I found this thing,

561
00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.792
I never could have
imagined its significance.

562
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.355
But this Commander Krang,

563
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.193
he said that this will help open
a portal to another dimension?

564
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.636
And when we do,
we'll join him in dominating this planet.

565
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.948
- We'll have ultimate power.
- Power.

566
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.393
And indescribable glory.

567
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.438
To be responsible for
opening the fabric between two worlds!

568
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.589
It's...

569
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.194
There are other pieces
required to open the portal.

570
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.673
If those four brothers are still out there,

571
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.072
we need to create soldiers
that can defeat them with a single blow.

572
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.116
And this will help us do that.

573
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.388
It needs to be synthesized.

574
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.551
Which is where you come in.

575
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.318
Ooh. Here come the brains.

576
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.198
Yo, Rock, check this out.

577
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.436
Beebs,
I got to get meself one of these.

578
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.476
Think of what we could do with this!

579
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.357
I feel like I'm back in science class.

580
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.759
Now all we need

581
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.028
are test subjects.

582
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160
Whoa!

583
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.350
Candidates that will easily
fall under my command.

584
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.032
Large in size.

585
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.234
Low in intellect.

586
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.908
That stings!

587
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.399
And not in a good way.

588
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.672
What's going on?

589
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.791
What is happening to us?

590
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.559
I don't know, but this feels great!

591
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.472
Oh, this is gonna be good!

592
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.313
This feels funny.

593
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.271
Feels like I have ants in my pants.

594
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.679
Big ants!

595
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.519
All right, Bebop and Rocksteady...

596
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.871
I know you're up there somewhere.

597
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.599
I knew it!

598
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.230
Omnus, scan subjects.

599
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.999
<i>Searching.</i>

600
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.359
Miraculous.

601
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.351
Inside every human
there's a dormant gene

602
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.670
which ties us to our animal ancestors.

603
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.439
It's as if that purple ooze

604
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.556
has returned them to their rightful place

605
00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.789
in the animal kingdom.

606
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.915
Whoa, Rock!

607
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.919
You're a rhinoceros.

608
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.639
And you're a...

609
00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.472
I don't know what you are.

610
00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.111
All right, let me look, let me look.
I'm a...

611
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.795
Huh. I'm a little piggy.

612
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.348
You're a warthog.

613
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.960
- Hey, Beebs!
- Yeah, Rock.

614
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.508
Ever see a rhino charge?

615
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.994
That hurts.

616
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.798
- I like it!
- Me, too!

617
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.309
Me, too.

618
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.230
Prepare the entire container.

619
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.798
The more of them we create,
the easier it will be to secure the portal.

620
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.673
My man!

621
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.880
This is awesome!

622
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.553
Check out the horn!

623
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.715
Yeah, baby!

624
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.439
Hey, man, check out
my tail. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

625
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.800
That is cool. Do I have one?

626
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.989
Hey, Rock, who is that?

627
00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.560
O'Neil.

628
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.839
Get that canister!

629
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.395
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

630
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.954
You guys don't really want
to do this again, right?

631
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.993
It doesn't usually
work out well for you guys.

632
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.793
Because I have the four friends.

633
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.476
They're green ninjas.

634
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.959
Give us the ooze.

635
00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520
Hi.

636
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.559
Where'd it go?

637
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.199
- Stop!
- Freeze!

638
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.910
See, that guy
with the hockey stick in the other alley,

639
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.399
I have nothing to do with that.

640
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.560
Whoo!

641
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.359
Thank you.

642
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.555
- What's your name?
- Casey Jones.

643
00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.751
- What's that?
- Casey Jones.

644
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.229
Stacy Moans?

645
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.360
Oh, uh...

646
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.589
Casey Jones.

647
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.869
Hi.

648
00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.758
- Get away from her!
- Hey! Whoa!

649
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.115
Get back.

650
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.635
Do not eat us.

651
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.509
We are not food.

652
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.155
The people of Earth
are not your enemies.

653
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.759
Yeah? Yeah.

654
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600
Watch this.

655
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.872
We were sent by the Supreme Leader

656
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.428
to eat delicious humans

657
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.275
and dip them in ranch dressing.

658
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.469
I'm just kidding.

659
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.993
I'm a vegan.
Except for meat and cheese and eggs.

660
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.955
Casey, they're my friends.

661
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.395
Oh. Oh, they...

662
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.799
They're your friends.

663
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.468
Yeah, they're my friends.

664
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.709
- Tell him.
- Yeah.

665
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.439
Donatello over there in the purple,
he's a technical genius,

666
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.829
who is technically a genius!

667
00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.474
Raphael over there in the red,
he's like a big cuddly teddy bear,

668
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.470
if big cuddly teddy bears
were incredibly violent.

669
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.199
This is Leonardo.
He's in the blue. Fearless leader.

670
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.753
Silent but deadly.

671
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.630
And I'm Michelangelo,
sporting my signature orange.

672
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.756
I'm a triple threat... Brains, brawn,

673
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.831
and obviously a dazzling personality.

674
00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.056
Ladies like to call me Mikey.

675
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.115
Are you done?

676
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.235
Yeah.

677
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.176
Sorry we're late, April.

678
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.953
You want to walk me through
what's going on here?

679
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.396
Uh, okay, um, so I went to go see Baxter,
but then Shredder was there.

680
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.119
And then he was talking
about opening up some sort of portal

681
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.515
to another dimension, and then he...

682
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.600
He took this purple ooze

683
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.752
and he injected it into those
two criminals that escaped with him.

684
00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.910
And then he turned
one of them into a rhinoceros

685
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.519
and the other one into a warthog.

686
00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.156
You have eyes on
Bebop and Rocksteady?

687
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.878
Why do you care about those two?

688
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.536
Let's just say that
I have a vested interest

689
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.993
in bringing them to justice.

690
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.229
Let's get back to the lair.

691
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.471
Raph, grab
<i>Friday the 13th</i> here and follow.

692
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.634
If he can help us find Bebop
and Rocksteady, he's coming with.

693
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.474
No, he's not. Not a chance.
I'm staying right here.

694
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.915
I'd agree with you, but you're wrong.

695
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.639
See, we, too, share a "vested interest."

696
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.631
I don't share anything with you guys.

697
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.789
Fellas, fellas...

698
00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.360
Now, the people of New York

699
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.073
need us to set aside our differences
and work together.

700
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.029
Which begs only one question.

701
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.510
Are you two guys like a thing or...

702
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.880
Come on, move it!

703
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.256
If this purple
ooze was injected into

704
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.838
Bebop and Rocksteady's bloodstream,

705
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.230
it's feasible that were I to pinpoint
a singular isotopic signature,

706
00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.595
I may be able to use it
to track their location.

707
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.070
And if we find them,
then we find Shredder.

708
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.752
Put them all in shackles!

709
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.195
And as long as
we all have our hockey masks,

710
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.918
what could go wrong?

711
00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.996
Seriously?
Now I'm taking wardrobe advice

712
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.832
from a bunch of Swamp Things...

713
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.354
Hey! Living in
an underground amusement park,

714
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.512
and have, forgive me,
the most pretentious names ever.

715
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.830
Uh, excuse me, I named them.

716
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.908
Hey, guys?

717
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.952
Nobody move. Don't move!

718
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.597
There is a giant rat back there.

719
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.236
- Yeah, we've, uh...
- Mmm-hmm.

720
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.117
Seen him around here before.

721
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.270
You know, there's only
one way to get rid of him.

722
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.554
You got to get low.

723
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.709
Low! Yeah.

724
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.559
When you go at him, you got to go fast,
and you got to go hard.

725
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.955
We believe in you, Casey Jones.
It's all you, bro.

726
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.616
Exactly.
We need you to get him.

727
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.119
Three, two, one, go!

728
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.636
Giant rat, 1. New guy, 0.

729
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.951
I can't
believe it was that easy.

730
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.508
I almost thought he wasn't
gonna do it for a second.

731
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.477
Good stuff. Good stuff.

732
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.228
We should really
have people over more often.

733
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.875
You're leaving?

734
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.757
If I can find my way out of here, I am.

735
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.638
You know, I was doing
just fine tracking Bebop and Rocksteady,

736
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.711
and then you just T-boned my existence.

737
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.040
So now I'm gonna find them
or I'm gonna go down swinging.

738
00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.856
- Casey...
- No, it's like they say,

739
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.633
"If you want to get work done,
don't spend time at the zoo."

740
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.678
"Tartaruga Brothers"?

741
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.999
That's the...

742
00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.999
That's the truck.

743
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.033
It was them.

744
00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.349
Who are these guys?

745
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.955
These four have done more for this city
than you will ever know

746
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.031
or they will ever take credit for.

747
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.439
So if you want to go down swinging,

748
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.715
these guys hit harder than anyone.

749
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.553
All right, Donnie, you got this.

750
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.274
Okay.

751
00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.839
Dissolve the quadra-helix bonds
and reverse the cohesion.

752
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.235
Wait.

753
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.719
That would mean...

754
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.557
Is it really possible?

755
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.517
We have confirmation, Master Shredder.

756
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.319
The canister of purple ooze
is at police headquarters.

757
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.039
Take a team. Recover it at all costs.

758
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.317
I'll retrieve the first piece needed
to open the portal.

759
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.594
How many men do you want?

760
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.148
This job is too important for just men.

761
00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.470
I'm bringing with me the next generation

762
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.710
of finely tuned combat soldiers.

763
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.030
Hey, uh, I've been meaning
to ask you this, Rock.

764
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.639
Do I look fat to you?

765
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.753
Fat? Oh, no, buddy, no.

766
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.479
You look

767
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.075
really fat!

768
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.232
The belly must be jelly,
'cause jam don't shake like that.

769
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.719
- My man!
- My man!

770
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.640
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

771
00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.030
Leo. Leo! Leo!

772
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.994
Leo!

773
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.075
Leo! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. This is amazing!

774
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.799
Leo, Leo, okay.
You're not gonna believe this.

775
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.429
Okay, I made a solution
from a sample of the purple ooze,

776
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.556
right, to expedite analysis of the isotope?

777
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.791
But while I was waiting for it
to catalyze, I started thinking,

778
00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.077
if the purple ooze can
turn humans into animals,

779
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.073
perhaps if properly reengineered...

780
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.468
Watch this. Watch this.

781
00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.152
It could turn us

782
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.752
into humans.

783
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.674
If we could get
our hands on more of this stuff,

784
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.637
it could be life changing!

785
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.192
We don't need that kind of change.

786
00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.159
Okay. You're right.

787
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.360
To blend in with humans

788
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.039
could compromise
our strategic advantage.

789
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.591
We have a system that works.

790
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.351
We shouldn't mess with the formula.

791
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.960
And Donnie.

792
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.553
Listen.

793
00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.995
You can't say a word
of this to the others.

794
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.356
Wow. Look at this place.

795
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.352
And to think, the entire universe,

796
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.034
it all started with the Big Bang.

797
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.759
Yeah, Beebs?
Well, I got a "Big Bang" for you.

798
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.793
Oh, man! That is awful!
That is the worst!

799
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.836
- Smash it.
- That's what we do!

800
00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.880
- Ow!
- That rock is hard.

801
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.952
- Can't feel my legs.
- Twisted my melon, man.

802
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.468
Only one piece left to recover.

803
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.875
Get ready to take a trip, boys.

804
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.911
You're going to Brazil.

805
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.468
Oh, my Speedo's already packed!

806
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.296
I didn't believe it,

807
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.436
but then Donnie showed him
it could really work.

808
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.875
It was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

809
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.350
It gave me hope.

810
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.360
Maybe we don't have to be
stuck down here forever, you know.

811
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.518
So Leo told Donnie to keep it a secret.

812
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.759
From us?

813
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.515
- Uh... No. Hold on.
- Who does he think he is?

814
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.270
No, wait.
Hey, look, if you tell Leo

815
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.197
that I told you that Donnie told him...

816
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.314
We'll never finish
our hip-hop Christmas album!

817
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.033
Pop quiz.

818
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.754
What are the three most
important traits of the ninja?

819
00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.474
Speed.

820
00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.077
Stealth.

821
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.954
And honor.

822
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.517
Where's the honor
in keeping secrets from your brothers?

823
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.360
I don't know what you're talking about.

824
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.110
So now you're adding lying to the list.

825
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.112
If you're referring to what Donnie
told me about the purple ooze,

826
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.715
it's called
"compartmentalization of information."

827
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.672
If there's even a chance
that ooze can make us human...

828
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.558
We're turtles, whether you like it or not.

829
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.959
It's not about what I like,

830
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.679
it's about what people up there
are willing to accept.

831
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.194
True acceptance only comes from within.

832
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.396
Don't give me that fortune cookie muck!

833
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.552
You should consult with us before you
decide to do something like that!

834
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.870
I consulted Donnie. And we decided...

835
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.871
And what about Mikey?
He don't get a vote?

836
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.030
There's only one vote
that counts in this family!

837
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.394
Mine!

838
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.355
Leo.

839
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.829
Leo, an alarm just tripped
at the Hayden Planetarium.

840
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.353
We have to get uptown.

841
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.112
Gear up, Donnie.

842
00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.199
You two stay here.

843
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.354
You're benching me?

844
00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.510
- Call it what you want.
- What'd I do?

845
00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.749
Sorry, guys.

846
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.914
Well, that went well.

847
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.356
The nerve this guy has. Big timing us!

848
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.359
He may be fine with the status quo,

849
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.856
but that don't mean we can't
make our own decisions.

850
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.757
Yeah!

851
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.035
Wait. Wait. What are you saying?

852
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.317
It means there's more
where that purple ooze came from.

853
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.556
And we're gonna get our hands on it.

854
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.278
Yeah!

855
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.797
I still don't know what you're saying.

856
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.952
Are we... Are we doing something?

857
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.316
Wow. The American Museum
of Natural History.

858
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.197
I've always wanted to come here.

859
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.199
Quit screwing around, Donnie.

860
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.040
Thirty seconds
till the cops are at the door.

861
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.800
- Donnie...
- Whoa.

862
00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.840
Boo-yah.

863
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.790
Shredder and the mutants
were definitely here.

864
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.799
And I'm detecting traces of neutronium,

865
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.154
the critical ingredient required
for creating a controlled black hole.

866
00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:03.478
Which is the only thing capable of
rupturing the space-time continuum.

867
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.678
And you know what that means!

868
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.193
No. I don't, Donnie.

869
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.192
It means Shredder may not be
as nuts as I thought.

870
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.599
From the data I just collected,

871
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.672
I'm surmising that
what was inside this thing

872
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.072
may help Shredder
open that portal to another dimension.

873
00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.594
Okay, what I want to know is,

874
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.752
if a portal's gonna open up,

875
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.673
what's coming through
from the other side?

876
00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.518
So you want to break
into police headquarters.

877
00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.829
Uh... Yeah.

878
00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.680
Donnie said he needs
more of the purple ooze

879
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.671
to track Bebop and Rocksteady.

880
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.832
And you said the cops would've logged it
into Evidence Control Room by now.

881
00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.480
Okay, and Leo is good with this plan?

882
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.038
Actually, I'm in charge on this one.

883
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.274
- Ain't that right, Mikey?
- You're right.

884
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.240
Look.

885
00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:01.032
So, we can take
the elevator shafts and vents.

886
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.152
We need you two to stay on the ground.

887
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.480
Whoa. I...

888
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.790
I can't just walk
right into police headquarters.

889
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.071
- What are you, chicken?
- Hey!

890
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.239
Who are you calling chicken, turtle?

891
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.833
Look, do you want to find
Bebop and Rocksteady or not?

892
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.720
So we're breaking
into police headquarters.

893
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.478
We got one last boondoggle.

894
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.029
We need to find someone to sneak
you guys past security checkpoint.

895
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.959
Only plan I got so far

896
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.750
may be a tad less than appetizing.

897
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.279
Are we going somewhere?

898
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.816
I'm gonna take a photo
with all of you, don't worry,

899
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.273
everybody's gonna get one tonight.

900
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.833
- Hey, Vern.
- Yeah?

901
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.319
Big fan. Big fan.

902
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.994
My gosh, Carmelo Anthony,
right back at ya!

903
00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.149
Nice key to the city.

904
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.176
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I mean, they give these things out.

905
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.576
Hey, Melo...
Do you mind if I call you Melo?

906
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.635
Not at all.

907
00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.800
Listen, I'm really glad
that you stopped me, because,

908
00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.056
guys like you and me,
we're kind of the same.

909
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.229
Right.

910
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.880
We bring a lot of
joy and hope into people's lives.

911
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.518
We got that kind of star power.

912
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.194
And while it's a gift,
this bond that we have...

913
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.508
- There you are.
- Hey.

914
00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.519
Melo, I'd like to introduce you
to my girlfriend, Alessandra.

915
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.936
Girlfriend? We just met a week ago.

916
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.995
Nice to meet you.

917
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.389
Now we're all over each other. Stop it!

918
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.714
- You know, um, um...
- Vern!

919
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.840
You know, what might be
a great idea is if we, uh...

920
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.955
Vern!

921
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.193
- I don't know...
- We need to go.

922
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.788
And, uh, bring that
key to the city with you.

923
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.439
- I think you need to go.
- Yep.

924
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.389
Unbelievable, you know?

925
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.914
I mean, your jealousy knows no limits.

926
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.157
- We need your help.
- We? Who's "we"?

927
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.197
Well, well, well,
if it ain't the prince of the city.

928
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.111
You know what? Give me a break, Raph.

929
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.856
You're the one who told me to take credit
for Shredder in the first place.

930
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.394
And now in light of the fact
that he is who knows where,

931
00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.736
I am starting to have profound regrets
about our arrangement.

932
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.672
So, are we just gonna
stand around and talk or...

933
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.996
- Who's this guy?
- Total loser, bro.

934
00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.191
I mean, nice enough fella,

935
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.191
if you like guys
who can't even bench press.

936
00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.075
Boom!

937
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.434
Or fill out a T-shirt.

938
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.551
Vern, he's a part of the plan.

939
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.240
What plan is that?

940
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.077
The plan to break
into police headquarters.

941
00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.550
- What?
- We need to find Shredder.

942
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.434
"We"? No, no, no. No, we're not doing...

943
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.795
Listen, I'd love to help
you guys out, but I can't.

944
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.388
- I got concert tickets to a lunch.
- Sweet key.

945
00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.233
- Does it go to something?
- No, it's just the city.

946
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.512
Vern, as the resident new guy
in this band of freaky misfits,

947
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.550
do yourself a favor, and just roll with it.

948
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.550
Hey, new guy, all I do is roll with it.

949
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.359
I've been rolling with it

950
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.994
since you were wearing baby T-shirts
because you were a baby.

951
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.071
Police headquarters. Thirty minutes.

952
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.353
See you there.

953
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.634
- See you there.
- He just said that.

954
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.629
Hey, guys.

955
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.790
Look who it is.
Vern "The Falcon" Fenwick!

956
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.120
Let's take a picture, huh? Come on.

957
00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.038
Yeah, I'll just take one
and send it to all you guys. Just gotta...

958
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.918
...do, like, a panorama thing there...

959
00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.269
You guys look good.

960
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.200
- Any time now, Mikey.
- I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.

961
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.440
Yes!

962
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.118
All right, smile. Smile for your...

963
00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.400
The meeting's in 10 minutes.

964
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.120
I need to see...

965
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.479
Cowabunga.

966
00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.068
Oh, hey, Mikey. What's up?

967
00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.355
<i>- Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>
- What's going on?

968
00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.816
The Foot Clan have the purple ooze!

969
00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.720
We need backup
at police headquarters right now!

970
00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.176
Hang tight, Mikey. We'll be right there.

971
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.349
We're on the move.

972
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.873
We have to get above the exit!

973
01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.670
What, are you crazy? We can't be seen!

974
01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.035
That purple ooze
is our only shot at being normal,

975
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.680
and it's heading toward the front door.

976
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.194
Freeze!

977
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.398
You with me or not?

978
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.549
Let's go!

979
01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.576
Raph, what are you doing with that?

980
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.200
Freeze!

981
01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.477
- Don't move! Don't move!
- No, no, no.

982
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.376
Show me your hands!

983
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.550
- Hold it!
- Freeze right there!

984
01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.896
Don't move! We will shoot!

985
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.816
- Get down on the ground.
- Wait! We're the good guys!

986
01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.115
- Get on the ground!
- All right, okay.

987
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.078
What are those things?

988
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.273
They're monsters.

989
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.231
They're monsters!

990
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.113
We're not monsters.

991
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.351
No! No! No! Don't shoot!

992
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.360
- Stop it! No, don't!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.

993
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.835
Go.

994
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.313
Go now!

995
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.276
Get to the ground slowly. Get down!

996
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.832
Jones, you've got to be kidding me.

997
01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.109
Put these two in holding.

998
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.155
Jade, what we just saw
stays in the department.

999
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.832
The public doesn't need to know.

1000
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.509
It is all over the police scanner,
they are hunting you.

1001
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.280
- What happened up there?
- Tell him, Raph.

1002
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.216
Tell him how you broke rank
and got us all exposed.

1003
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.336
For the most selfish reason.

1004
01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.816
The Foot were gonna
get their hands on it.

1005
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.955
You didn't know that!

1006
01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.416
Stealing from police headquarters...

1007
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.856
There's no scenario
where you wouldn't get caught.

1008
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.536
Maybe if you hadn't lied
to your own flesh and blood...

1009
01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.198
Oh, wait. The way you lied to April?

1010
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.236
And now she's taking
the fall for your mess.

1011
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.121
You should've
seen the looks on their faces.

1012
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.310
They weren't just scared.

1013
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.833
There was

1014
01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.679
actual hate.

1015
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.077
It will be all right, my son.

1016
01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.355
People fear what they do not understand.

1017
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.670
You can't walk away from this.

1018
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.159
I told him, Master Splinter.

1019
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.754
But Raph, he never hears
a word I have to say.

1020
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.176
Now, I knew they couldn't
handle the truth about the purple ooze,

1021
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.760
and you know what,
they proved me right.

1022
01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.320
- Leonardo.
- I don't know what to do!

1023
01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.952
Donnie's nose is in his computer,

1024
01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.439
Raph's brains are in his biceps,

1025
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.192
and Mikey's head's in the clouds!

1026
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.998
I can't get them all on the same page.

1027
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.399
To think with one mind.

1028
01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.597
You shouldn't want them all
to think the same.

1029
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.280
It's their different points of view
that make the team strong.

1030
01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.754
A good leader understands this.

1031
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.718
A good brother accepts it.

1032
01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.030
Guys? I got something!

1033
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.856
Talk to me, Donnie.

1034
01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.599
The computer's pinpointed
the isotopic signature of the purple ooze.

1035
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.032
I can track Bebop and Rocksteady's
exact coordinates.

1036
01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.431
I got 'em.

1037
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.755
They're at 36,000 feet,
traveling at 490 knots.

1038
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.519
Whoa. They've achieved
the power of flight!

1039
01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.033
Good for them, you know.

1040
01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.272
They're on a plane, Mikey.

1041
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360
Oh.

1042
01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.992
It looks like our mutant buddies
are headed to Brazil.

1043
01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.216
How do we get there?

1044
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.674
We sneak
onto the next cargo plane from JFK.

1045
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.231
They're not monsters, okay?

1046
01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.120
The only real monster
in this city is Shredder

1047
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.720
and the two mutants that he's created.

1048
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.193
Bebop and Rocksteady.

1049
01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.736
If you think anything
coming out of your mouth

1050
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.479
is gonna add to her credibility,
you are sorely mistaken.

1051
01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.074
Shredder mutated them
with the help of Baxter Stockman.

1052
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.696
That's actually who you need to go see.

1053
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.836
Funny you should mention Dr. Stockman

1054
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.751
because we just finished analyzing

1055
01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.638
some security footage
from TCRI that he gave us.

1056
01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.711
- Great.
- Guess who's on it.

1057
01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.352
That's not what happened.

1058
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.320
That footage has been altered.
It's been edited.

1059
01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.271
We checked its authenticity.

1060
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.429
It's clean.

1061
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.640
I want a phone call.

1062
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.616
I hate to break it to you,
but all the phones have been shut down

1063
01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.760
on account of monsters
breaking into our stationhouse.

1064
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.478
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1065
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.397
but legally I'm entitled to a phone call.

1066
01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.160
- Tell me where they are.
- I don't know.

1067
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.031
But if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1068
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.119
Chief,

1069
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.593
the turtles are not the ones
you should be chasing.

1070
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.875
Ha-ha! We found it!

1071
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.393
Lookee here.

1072
01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.950
I like it.

1073
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.496
<i>Boss, boss, we did it! We did it!</i>

1074
01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.478
<i>We got that super-important-thingy-
kind-of-hard-thing-to-find thing.</i>

1075
01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.313
<i>Move, move. Move your head over.
He's got to see me. Hey, boss!</i>

1076
01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.597
They have the fi nal piece
and are heading back.

1077
01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.673
Countdown to the big show
is officially on.

1078
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.672
And we are ready for action!

1079
01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.832
All systems are, uh... Standing by.

1080
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.511
Can you taste it, Sensei Shredder?

1081
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.668
The magnificence of
what we're about to do?

1082
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.073
Yummy, isn't it?

1083
01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.557
Aren't there supposed to be, like,

1084
01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.235
pretty stewardesses handing out
warm hand towels and stuff?

1085
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.279
Not down here, Mikey.

1086
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.359
Not for us.

1087
01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.155
Oh, boy. Bebop
and Rocksteady are en route

1088
01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.680
- back to New York.
- What?

1089
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.896
They must have already retrieved

1090
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.275
the last piece they needed
to open the portal.

1091
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.656
Looks like our plane's about
to cross over theirs, right?

1092
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.750
Yeah, with
a 3,000-foot separation.

1093
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.474
Uh, I could plot a course for intercept,
but we'd have to jump.

1094
01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.915
Jump?

1095
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.680
Oh, boy.

1096
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.230
Guys, I don't know
if this is such a good plan.

1097
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.959
Oh, Come on, don't go
getting soft on me now, Raph.

1098
01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.752
This is gonna be fun.

1099
01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.319
We got to go now.
We only have a 30-second window.

1100
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.628
You know the plan.

1101
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.596
- Uh... Dudes?
- What?

1102
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.999
He jumped.

1103
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.318
- He jumped?
- Uh-huh.

1104
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.833
All right, one for all.

1105
01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.376
Wait, wait, wait! You don't have a chute!

1106
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.400
Whoo!

1107
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.480
I don't need a chute. I got my board!

1108
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.318
Oh! This is awesome!

1109
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.953
I'm off.

1110
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.513
I'm off... I'm off target!

1111
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.999
Need a lift, bro?

1112
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.714
- Slow down, Mikey!
- Prepare for the ouch.

1113
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.318
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

1114
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960
Gotcha!

1115
01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.273
Hang on, Mikey.

1116
01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.515
Lock in.

1117
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.033
Where's Raph?

1118
01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.836
Okay. Okay, you got this. You got this.

1119
01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.152
What would Vin Diesel do?

1120
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.598
No regret, no fear.

1121
01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:53.711
No regret, no fear.

1122
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.435
No regret... No fear!

1123
01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.320
Ahhh! I regret this! Fear sucks!

1124
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.911
Isn't he coming in kind of fast?

1125
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.028
Raph!

1126
01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.549
Nice catch.

1127
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.240
Uh-oh!

1128
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.517
The good news is you're wearing chutes.

1129
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.635
Chutes.

1130
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.789
The bad news is...

1131
01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.319
Okay. This must be
what they came to Brazil for.

1132
01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.834
It's the interdimensional
portal-opening thingy-ma-bob.

1133
01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.117
Well, there's probably
a more technical name for it, but...

1134
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.428
Uh...

1135
01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.758
Guys?

1136
01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.189
Oh.

1137
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280
Oh, boy.

1138
01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.788
Dude! Bringing back the Mohawk!

1139
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.995
Good for you.

1140
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.936
Y'all got jokes, huh?

1141
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.236
Well, let's see how funny you are
after we bash your heads in!

1142
01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.554
Watch it!

1143
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.949
Careful!

1144
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.879
Mommy!

1145
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.075
Guys!

1146
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.678
Dude! Seriously?

1147
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.115
Yep, that's my bad.
I got a little carried away.

1148
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.239
I got it! I got it!

1149
01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.436
- I'll take that.
- I don't got it.

1150
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.116
Don't worry, guys,
I'll level out the plane!

1151
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.713
And there's no cockpit.

1152
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.118
Careful, as some of the items
may have shifted during flight.

1153
01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.836
Oh!

1154
01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.630
How you
doing up there, Donnie?

1155
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.235
Uh... Everything is great.
I'm doing awesome.

1156
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320
Oh!

1157
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400
Whoa!

1158
01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.399
- This pig is flying!
- Leo!

1159
01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.640
Raph!

1160
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.430
- Everyone okay?
- I'm good.

1161
01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.588
I'm good!

1162
01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.153
Wait, where's Raph?

1163
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.750
Land!

1164
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.391
Land! Land! Land!

1165
01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.114
Well, this is awkward.

1166
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.118
Let's rumble, baby!

1167
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.959
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1168
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.794
I got you, I got you.

1169
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.956
- Leo, no!
- Eyes up, Donnie!

1170
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.309
Coming through!

1171
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.789
Gotcha!

1172
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200
Aw!

1173
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.034
I got it, I got it, I got it!

1174
01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.319
Donnie!

1175
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.314
Thanks, buddy.

1176
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.152
- My man.
- My man!

1177
01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.273
Bye, turtles!

1178
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.550
That's nice of them to say good-bye.

1179
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.311
- Heads up!
- Wait, what?

1180
01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.879
Thanks, guys.

1181
01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.795
Real team effort.

1182
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.388
If you're gonna press charges,
just press charges.

1183
01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.033
And you still owe her a phone call.

1184
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.311
I don't owe anybody anything

1185
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.199
until you tell me
where those turtle things came from.

1186
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.599
From New Hampshire.

1187
01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720
Wow.

1188
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.276
You're actually even
a bigger loser than I thought.

1189
01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.273
Don't worry about her, Casey.
She's just trying to get under your skin.

1190
01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.118
Nah, she's right.

1191
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.391
Been hearing that my whole life.

1192
01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.273
You know, I've only
ever really had one goal.

1193
01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.957
I wanted to make detective
in the New York City Police Department.

1194
01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.751
I wanted to put criminals away,
not just keep them in cages.

1195
01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.476
But working Corrections,
you do learn two good things.

1196
01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.233
One, justice comes
in all shapes and sizes.

1197
01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320
And two,

1198
01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.750
it's way easier to pick
a cop's pocket than you might think.

1199
01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.479
Make your call.

1200
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.795
- Yeah?
- Vern...

1201
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.348
O'Neil!

1202
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.160
Vern, listen, I need you to...

1203
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.993
What is that sound?

1204
01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.196
Just a little side venture. Falcon breath.

1205
01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.595
Turns out, people
are willing to pay $200 a pop

1206
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.795
for a bag of my hot air.

1207
01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.200
Okay, look, forget that I asked.

1208
01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.953
Casey and I are in police custody.

1209
01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.549
Shocking!

1210
01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.816
Why would they want to question you?

1211
01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.776
I mean, just because
you broke into their headquarters.

1212
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.336
Vern, look, I've got bigger problems
than myself right now, okay?

1213
01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.920
Baxter Stockman doctored
the footage from TCRI,

1214
01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.176
but I'm betting that
there's some sort of a secondary feed

1215
01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.776
that will show that
he's been working with Shredder

1216
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.936
and that they turned Bebop
and Rocksteady into mutants.

1217
01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.428
Look, uh... What do you want from me?

1218
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.840
I want you to be the hero
that the whole city thinks you are.

1219
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.393
- Coming through.
- It's a restricted area.

1220
01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.039
"Restricted"?

1221
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.791
You know, I know
something that will open

1222
01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.757
just about any door in this town.

1223
01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.748
Key to the city.

1224
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.800
You are The Falcon?

1225
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.799
You haven't earned the respect yet
to say my name out loud.

1226
01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.070
You want to put yourself
on the path to that respect,

1227
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.760
run downstairs
and grab me a mochaccino.

1228
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.268
Secondary surveillance,
where would you be?

1229
01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.549
Come on, Vern...

1230
01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.632
You were a cameraman
before you got all fancy.

1231
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.112
One camera, two camera, three camera.

1232
01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.598
Why isn't there a fourth...

1233
01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.278
Hidden camera. Bingo!

1234
01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.713
<i>Right on time.</i>

1235
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.056
<i>You think standing on the
sidelines makes you some kind of hero?</i>

1236
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.320
<i>You can't just
push past me like that, bro!</i>

1237
01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.560
You were being a nitwit!
You were gonna lose that thing!

1238
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.056
I had it right in my hand,
and you acted like I wasn't even there!

1239
01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.976
It's not my job to make
your presence known, all right?

1240
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.256
Get out of your head and communicate!

1241
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.669
Well, what do you expect?
He's all logic, no skills!

1242
01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.990
Coming from the guy
who's all instinct, no restraint!

1243
01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.336
Dude, what do you know about anything?

1244
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.713
You're all heart and no brains.

1245
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.456
How could you?
You may know a lot about strategy,

1246
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.072
but you know nothing about feelings.

1247
01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.829
Fair enough.

1248
01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.910
You want to know
the one thing I am feeling?

1249
01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.431
We may be brothers,

1250
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.112
but we are not a team.

1251
01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.272
- It's working!
- Yes.

1252
01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.033
We did it.

1253
01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.496
Once it's fully powered,
the portal will be just wide enough

1254
01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.715
for the Technodrome
to come through piece by piece.

1255
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.199
This is gonna be insane!

1256
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.955
Galileo... Isaac Newton...

1257
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.589
Steve Jobs.

1258
01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.913
Their names will be
footnotes in the annals of science

1259
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.911
after what's about to happen here.

1260
01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.480
Chief Vincent.

1261
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.548
I'm Vern Fenwick.
You might know me as The...

1262
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.308
Doesn't matter. Listen.

1263
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.993
You need to see this.

1264
01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:25.433
<i>- Hey, Rock, who is that?
- O'Neil.</i>

1265
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.911
<i>Get that canister!</i>

1266
01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.234
Let them go.

1267
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240
Thank you,

1268
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.749
"Falcon."

1269
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200
Uh, Chief?

1270
01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.954
You might need this.

1271
01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.593
Well played.

1272
01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:50.073
Great. So I've got a rhino
and a warthog to add to our troubles.

1273
01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.273
Good looking out.

1274
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.349
Anytime.

1275
01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.670
I want an APB on a Dr. Baxter Stockman.

1276
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.398
And get a few...

1277
01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.991
What's happening out there, Donnie?

1278
01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.754
Oh, my gosh.

1279
01:21:58.600 --> 01:21:59.919
Shredder did it.

1280
01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.398
The portal's opening.

1281
01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.799
Where did that come from?

1282
01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.272
Amazing.
This alien warship

1283
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.680
is coming through piece by piece.

1284
01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.830
Hacking into the main data core.

1285
01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.831
Okay. Ship's designate is

1286
01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.554
the Technodrome.

1287
01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.835
Commanding Officer
goes by the name of Krang.

1288
01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.517
I don't know that guy, but I hate that guy!

1289
01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.256
If Krang were to finish
building this thing,

1290
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.759
it wouldn't just be a ship.

1291
01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.513
It would be a war machine
that would end all life here.

1292
01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.397
It would be the end of the world.

1293
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.990
But there is something we can do.

1294
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.435
The atmosphere around
the Technodrome would be toxic

1295
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.909
to anyone with
a standard cardiovascular system.

1296
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.155
What are you saying?

1297
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.560
We may be the only ones
who can survive around that portal,

1298
01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.056
the only ones who can get close enough

1299
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.150
to this T echnodrome to shut it down.

1300
01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.879
But how? We're being hunted.
They think we're monsters.

1301
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.720
Yeah, we're gonna
need the cops at our backs.

1302
01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.593
They're trying to lock us up.

1303
01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.994
Unless...

1304
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.355
One sip, and we'll stay
the same on the inside,

1305
01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.509
but look like humans on the outside.

1306
01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.512
Your boyhood is drawing to an end.

1307
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.591
You are becoming young men.

1308
01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.914
The choice is yours.

1309
01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.431
I'll do whatever you guys say.

1310
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.869
It's your call.

1311
01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.792
You're sure they're coming?

1312
01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.828
They're coming.

1313
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.195
- Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire.

1314
01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.880
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

1315
01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.191
What are you?

1316
01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.596
We're not really into labels.

1317
01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.558
Some call us freaks. Monsters.

1318
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.794
Let's just say
we're four brothers from New York

1319
01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.874
who hate bullies and love this city.

1320
01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.511
And right now, we're the city's best hope.

1321
01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.552
Why should I believe you?

1322
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.111
You don't have to take it from us.

1323
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.713
Take it from him.

1324
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.315
Go ahead, Vern.

1325
01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.480
Tell her about the arrangement.

1326
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.192
What arrangement?

1327
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.633
Oh, that... Arrangement.

1328
01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.720
Look, The Falcon is still The Falcon.

1329
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.713
I just may have gotten by
with a little help from my friends.

1330
01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.155
These four are the ones
who took Shredder down the first time.

1331
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.793
I was kind of more of a wingman.

1332
01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.189
We've been doing our part
to protect this city

1333
01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.074
from the shadows.

1334
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.709
And we think we have something to offer.

1335
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.231
- We're gonna need...
- Strategy.

1336
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:26.959
Instinct.

1337
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.828
Logic.

1338
01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.798
And boatloads of heart.

1339
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.669
Load up!

1340
01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.640
April, Casey and Vern
need an escort to Pier 90.

1341
01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.148
The electromagnetic force
of the portal is coming from there.

1342
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.480
Forwarding you the coordinates.

1343
01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.873
Send a team!

1344
01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.360
Take us to the Chrysler Building.

1345
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.035
We'll make our way up to his ship
and take down Krang on his home turf.

1346
01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.278
Come on, O'Neil, get in!

1347
01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.856
I installed
a breathing apparatus in your helmet.

1348
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.871
This will help us survive
the unique atmosphere

1349
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.433
of the assembling Technodrome.

1350
01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.910
And I made a handheld version
of the teleportation devi...

1351
01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.198
Look at what we've done.
This is undeniable.

1352
01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.759
We'll be gods to future generations.

1353
01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.071
I'll be a god.

1354
01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.230
You'll be just what you've always been.

1355
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.919
What's that?

1356
01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.999
A footnote.

1357
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.554
- No.
- Take him to our facility in Tokyo.

1358
01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.831
No! No! No! No! No!
You can't do this to me!

1359
01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.990
No, you... No. No, you will... No!

1360
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.039
I've done everything you asked!
You promised! No!

1361
01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.510
I am a legend! I will be...
No! I will be a legend!

1362
01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.359
You cannot do this to me.

1363
01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.513
The world will know my name!

1364
01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.395
No one will ever know who you are.

1365
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.551
We're 90 seconds out.

1366
01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.753
I've got tactical gear, weapons,
communications standing by.

1367
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.478
All we need is cover to get up there.

1368
01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.160
When we do,
we've got to find that beacon

1369
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.840
that's drawing all those pieces together.

1370
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.816
If we can send that beacon
back to where it came from,

1371
01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.479
and April, Casey and Vern
can close that portal on our command...

1372
01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.959
Good-bye, T echnodrome.

1373
01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.479
Good-bye, Krang.

1374
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.039
T eam effort.

1375
01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.593
T eam effort.

1376
01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:47.936
All right, they're splitting up.

1377
01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.176
Wait, we aren't going with the turtles?

1378
01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.616
Why aren't we going with the turtles?

1379
01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.000
When something bad happens,
you want to be with the turtles!

1380
01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.679
Commander Krang.

1381
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.956
There you are, Shredder!

1382
01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.951
I thought you'd never get here.

1383
01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.557
As you asked, the beacon has been set.

1384
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.918
And once the Technodrome
reassembles, we can rule the planet.

1385
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.911
I'm sorry. "We"?

1386
01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.112
"We" will rule?

1387
01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.431
We were a team.

1388
01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.073
"We were a team!"

1389
01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.991
Teams are for the weak.

1390
01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:46.435
Family is for the scared.

1391
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.468
The Earth is my toy!

1392
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:53.109
And I do not like to share!

1393
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.508
You betrayed me!

1394
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.997
Actually, I barely even thought about you.

1395
01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:05.071
Back in the toy chest
with the rest of the things I've broken.

1396
01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.313
Silly little earthling.

1397
01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.111
Now for a new game.

1398
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.272
Look out, Earth! It's playtime.

1399
01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.034
Move it, let's go!

1400
01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.674
Go, move, move, move.
Get your team in position!

1401
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.040
Shields up!

1402
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.196
- Okay, let's get them in.
- Tight form on that barricade!

1403
01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.509
Advance!

1404
01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.200
Keep it tight!

1405
01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.193
- Casey!
- Hold on!

1406
01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.639
I'm going in.

1407
01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.553
Casey! Casey!

1408
01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.597
This thing's 57% complete.

1409
01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.680
If we don't stop it now,

1410
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.915
it's gonna be ready to go
in less than four minutes.

1411
01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.680
Guys,
what are we waiting for?

1412
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.071
- You got this?
- Yeah.

1413
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:40.708
I got this.

1414
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.518
Surf's up, New York!

1415
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.672
Do you hear that?

1416
01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.193
It sounds strange.

1417
01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.510
Like "alien spacecraft
in the sky" strange?

1418
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.035
No.

1419
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.639
That kind of strange.

1420
01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.236
We've got to keep
our eyes out for intruders.

1421
01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.276
Well, what do intruders look like?

1422
01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.590
Anybody that's not
a big pig or a big rhino.

1423
01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.680
Ah.

1424
01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.756
Oh. Oh, boy. Listen.

1425
01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:38.391
You guys secure the portal device.

1426
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:43.229
I'll deal with those two.

1427
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.480
"Secure the portal device"?
What does that even mean?

1428
01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.600
It means kick the butt
of anyone that's guarding it,

1429
01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.636
wait for Donnie's go signal,
and shut it down.

1430
01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.576
Yeah, but we don't know
how many people are guarding it!

1431
01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.749
Well, do you want to switch?

1432
01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.416
Yeah, no. We're gonna secure the portal.

1433
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.759
I thought so.

1434
01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:01.995
Hey, fellas!

1435
01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:04.195
Remember me?

1436
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.037
- Look who it is.
- Hey, cop, how's your noggin?

1437
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:11.198
- Come on!
- As you wish.

1438
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.079
It's on, baby!

1439
01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.754
Ultrasonic scanners indicate

1440
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.976
the beacon's location is
somewhere near the command module

1441
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.115
a few hundred feet ahead.

1442
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.176
Okay. We've got to stop
this thing from completing.

1443
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.997
And how are we
supposed to do that?

1444
01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.040
Let's start
with whatever that thing is.

1445
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.638
That must be Krang.

1446
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.518
All right, fall in, guys!

1447
01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.200
Whoa.

1448
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.391
It's not that bad, it's just a dumb robot.

1449
01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.876
Huh. I was expecting way worse.

1450
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.753
And what would that look like?

1451
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.229
I don't know, like a mustache maybe?

1452
01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.176
Evil goatee or something.
You know what I'm saying?

1453
01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.758
Ahhh!

1454
01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.393
It's like a chewed-up
piece of gum! With a face!

1455
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.751
I'll only warn you once. Get off my ship!

1456
01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.759
Donnie, get to the console.

1457
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.400
Let's send this jacked-up disco ball
back where it came from.

1458
01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.315
Hey, Bubblicious,
let's see what you've got.

1459
01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.956
I'll show you what I've got! This!

1460
01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.872
This dude's tougher than I thought.

1461
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.519
You better run!

1462
01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.154
You cannot escape the Bebop!

1463
01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.151
What? Why me?

1464
01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:06.511
Let's go! Come on, Mikey!

1465
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.957
You're going down, Krang!

1466
01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.756
Okay. About ninety seconds
before this thing is complete.

1467
01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.159
All you, Donnie.

1468
01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.988
No pressure, no pressure, no pressure.

1469
01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.716
You know,
I'm looking forward to enslaving you.

1470
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.270
A cage full of tortoises might be nice.

1471
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.472
We're turtles, not tortoises!
There's a big difference.

1472
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.560
Yeah. Turtles bite!

1473
01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.834
You don't think I've got spares for this?

1474
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.150
Guys, he is literally rearming.

1475
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.158
Gotcha, pipsqueak!

1476
01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:56.640
Whoa!

1477
01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.949
You see him, Rock?

1478
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.678
We know you're here somewhere.

1479
01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.280
- Donnie!
- Just give me ten seconds.

1480
01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.152
Guys? I don't think
I'm tall enough to ride this ride!

1481
01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.277
Stupid reptiles!

1482
01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.280
Leo, hang on!

1483
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.599
You're starting to be
a real pain in my butt.

1484
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.792
And do you know
what Bebop does with pains in his butt?

1485
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.639
Get over here, little boy.

1486
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.990
Put down that popsicle stick.

1487
01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.071
Ha! Game on, baby!

1488
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.000
Look. There's the portal device.

1489
01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.635
Oh, great. She has a sword.

1490
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.957
We have a hubcap.

1491
01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.274
Where's the beacon, Donnie?
We're running out of time!

1492
01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.391
You already have.

1493
01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.475
Prepare to watch your city crumble.

1494
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:18.896
What's happening, Donnie?

1495
01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.388
I was right.
It's a massive weapons system.

1496
01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.589
He's bringing it online!

1497
01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.272
I got it! I found the beacon! It's just

1498
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.273
up there.

1499
01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.954
- Mikey, go!
- Oh, I'll get that beacon.

1500
01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.759
Okay, turtles.

1501
01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.430
Play time is over!

1502
01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.320
Whoa!

1503
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.791
I'm vertical!

1504
01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:04.640
Oh, you want some, too?

1505
01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.631
I got it!

1506
01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.235
Get him, Rock!

1507
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.117
Whoa, stop, stop!

1508
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.557
Oh, no.

1509
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.960
- Rock.
- Yeah, Beebs?

1510
01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.039
My man.

1511
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.279
Hey! Heads up, Donnie.

1512
01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.239
The beacon!

1513
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.116
Come here, little turtle.

1514
01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.199
Let me give you a hug.

1515
01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.108
Good-bye.

1516
01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.760
Okay.

1517
01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.193
Raph! With me!

1518
01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.035
Little help, guys!

1519
01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.320
Hang on, little bro!

1520
01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.909
Nobody messes...

1521
01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.639
With Mikey!

1522
01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.233
No!

1523
01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.910
Guys, Krang is down,
but his ship's still building.

1524
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.760
Come on.

1525
01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:00.880
Donnie!

1526
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.993
Drone activated.

1527
01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.192
It's gonna be close.

1528
01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.911
<i>Guys, now! Close the portal now!</i>

1529
01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.120
I got this.

1530
01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.951
Yes!

1531
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.191
Okay, this is our stop.

1532
01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.237
I'll be back, turtles,

1533
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.473
a thousand times stronger!

1534
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.592
It's cool. It's cool.

1535
01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.636
Yeah, I knew that would work.

1536
01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.416
Wait, so you seriously
thought us four teenagers

1537
01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.714
could save the whole world?

1538
01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.875
Sure.

1539
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:39.474
Guys, we got something
no one else has.

1540
01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.112
- Turtle power!
- Garbage truck!

1541
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.832
Garbage truck?

1542
01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.753
- Well, we do have one.
- The other one.

1543
01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.236
Turtle power!

1544
01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.031
<i>Escaped convicts
Bebop and Rocksteady</i>

1545
01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.314
<i>are now in police custody,</i>

1546
01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.039
while Dr. Baxter Stockman
remains at large.

1547
01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:00.674
Authorities assure us that
the city is once again safe,

1548
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.633
however questions remain
about last week's events.

1549
01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.512
What was that threat from the sky

1550
01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.358
and how exactly was it averted?

1551
01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.954
But the bigger question is,
does it even matter?

1552
01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.918
Do we need to give our heroes
a name and a face?

1553
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.476
<i>Or is it enough
to know that they're out there</i>

1554
01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.710
<i>watching over us from the shadows?</i>

1555
01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.795
For your incredible valor
within this community,

1556
01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.793
and for your uncompromising
cooperation with this agency,

1557
01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.474
I present to you the keys to the city,

1558
01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.875
a symbol of our appreciation,

1559
01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.514
respect,

1560
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.710
and for our continued partnership.

1561
01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.835
To you brothers,

1562
01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.993
Leonardo,

1563
01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.355
Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo...

1564
01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.995
Uh...

1565
01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.275
Last name?

1566
01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.311
Uh... Not so much.

1567
01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.391
I never thought of that. That's no fair.

1568
01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.000
Congratulations.

1569
01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.910
I got one of those. No big deal.

1570
01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.916
I helped them. They're friends of mine.

1571
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.040
Oh.

1572
01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.919
So, you got plans next weekend?

1573
01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.754
Just my regular hockey game.

1574
01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.953
Do you want to come watch me play?

1575
01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.110
Watch? I'll take you one on one.

1576
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.113
And I'll kick your butt.

1577
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.074
I bet you will.

1578
01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:31.874
My key's totally bigger.

1579
01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.920
It's bigger than your key, man.
I got the big key.

1580
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.275
I think you should
give people more credit.

1581
01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.440
They'll accept you now.

1582
01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.872
You're probably right.

1583
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.314
But, uh...

1584
01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.835
I think we'll stick with
the arrangement we've had.

1585
01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.552
If you ever need us,
April knows where to find us.

1586
01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:53.960
Really?

1587
01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.029
You could live a normal life,

1588
01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.075
like the rest of us.

1589
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.399
Normal?

1590
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.872
What fun is that?

1591
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Yeah!
