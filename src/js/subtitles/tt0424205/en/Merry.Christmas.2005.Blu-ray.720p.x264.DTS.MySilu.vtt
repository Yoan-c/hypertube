1
00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:51.253
Child upon these maps do heed
This black stain to be effaced

2
00:01:51.753 --> 00:01:57.173
Omitting it you would proceed
Yet better it in red to trace

3
00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:00.258
Later, whatever may come to pass

4
00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.344
Promise there to go you must

5
00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:06.889
To fetch the children of Alsace
Reaching out their arms to us

6
00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:12.309
May in our fondest France
Hope's green saplings branch

7
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.311
And in you, dear child, flower
Grow, grow,

8
00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:19.271
France awaits its hour

9
00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:23.816
To rid the map of every trace
of Germany, and of the Hun

10
00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:26.026
We must exterminate that race

11
00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:28.194
We must not leave a single one

12
00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:30.321
Heed not their children's cries,

13
00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:32.656
Best slay all now, the women too

14
00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:34.907
Or else some day again they'll rise,

15
00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:37.493
Which if they're dead they cannot do

16
00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:40.369
We have a one and only enemy

17
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.871
Who digs the grave of Germany

18
00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:46.498
Its heart replete with hatred,
gall and envy

19
00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.084
We have a one and only enemy

20
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.586
The villain raises its murderous hand

21
00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:54.380
Its name you know, it is England

22
00:04:36.284 --> 00:04:37.410
This is it!

23
00:04:40.828 --> 00:04:43.455
War has been declared!

24
00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:46.749
Well, little brother?

25
00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:49.418
Going to spend the war
repainting statues?

26
00:04:49.876 --> 00:04:51.544
I've put you on the list too!

27
00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:56.922
In two days, we're all leaving
for basic training in Glasgow.

28
00:04:56.923 --> 00:05:00.467
At last, something's happening
in our lives!

29
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.968
Well, you coming?

30
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.664
Two more minutes, Mr. Sprink.

31
00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:42.037
I have been ordered to read this message
from our beloved Kaiser:

32
00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.082
This is a dark hour for Germany.

33
00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.418
Our land is besieged

34
00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:54.837
and we must brandish the sword.

35
00:07:55.796 --> 00:08:01.050
I hope that with God's help
we shall use it well,

36
00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:06.262
so we may re-sheathe it with dignity.

37
00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.560
Two more minutes, Lieutenant!

38
00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:52.002
We're going out!

39
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:56.213
100 meters to the German trenches.

40
00:09:56.963 --> 00:10:02.342
We've been shelling
their machine-gunners,

41
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.261
so we should be alright.

42
00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:08.928
We take their front line,
then the farm just behind!

43
00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:11.973
The 134th will relieve us tonight

44
00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:14.683
and we can rest up in the rear.

45
00:10:16.184 --> 00:10:18.811
We'll have back-up from the Scots
on our left.

46
00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:24.898
You'll recognize their black caps.
Don't worry about them,

47
00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:27.317
pay close heed to what I tell you to do.

48
00:10:28.777 --> 00:10:30.194
I'm like you.

49
00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:32.404
I too want to go home.

50
00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:37.741
So do what you must
and we'll all be home for Christmas.

51
00:10:46.414 --> 00:10:47.331
Right.

52
00:10:48.832 --> 00:10:50.208
Come what will.

53
00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:54.420
Fix bayonets!

54
00:11:05.343 --> 00:11:07.219
Load rifles!

55
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:15.934
Forward!

56
00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:47.915
Up along the sap!

57
00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:52.418
Get down!

58
00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:32.028
Don't stay here little brother...

59
00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:36.531
So one of us survives.

60
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:45.078
No, William.

61
00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:48.414
Come on, William...

62
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.547
I abandoned him.

63
00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:04.967
Like a coward! I abandoned him.

64
00:14:06.802 --> 00:14:09.970
I let him die, all alone!

65
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:12.139
You had no choice.

66
00:14:14.057 --> 00:14:18.936
And now, we must pray for him
and for all the other casualties.

67
00:14:24.856 --> 00:14:26.649
The reinforcements have arrived.

68
00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:29.401
We're leaving, Dale.

69
00:14:32.986 --> 00:14:35.529
You stay here with the wounded.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

70
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.073
I'll see you back at base.

71
00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:52.500
I know you're in the trenches, Father.

72
00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:56.086
It's me.

73
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.132
It's Andrew Duncan.

74
00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:04.592
I'm not far, Padre.

75
00:15:09.512 --> 00:15:12.472
Father, I'm eight,

76
00:15:12.473 --> 00:15:13.932
eight feet...

77
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.267
Father.

78
00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:25.773
The others are too far away, but me...

79
00:15:26.732 --> 00:15:27.816
Father.

80
00:15:28.525 --> 00:15:30.526
You've got to come out and help.

81
00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:36.030
That's it.

82
00:15:37.156 --> 00:15:41.451
Just walk straight ahead
and you'll be on top of me.

83
00:15:45.203 --> 00:15:48.080
I knew I could count on you, Father.

84
00:15:49.914 --> 00:15:52.750
Father, what are you doing?
This is suicide!

85
00:15:57.587 --> 00:16:01.256
Don't run off like that! Damn you!

86
00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:05.383
Get back! Get back here!

87
00:16:05.384 --> 00:16:10.804
We're ordered to stay in the trench!
- Cease fire!

88
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.807
That was a stretcher-bearer.
- What?

89
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.644
You shot a stretcher-bearer.

90
00:16:19.685 --> 00:16:21.353
How do you know?

91
00:16:23.563 --> 00:16:25.314
You fired first?

92
00:16:27.232 --> 00:16:29.733
A Scots marauder, Sir!

93
00:16:29.734 --> 00:16:31.942
Think I got him.
- Good.

94
00:16:31.943 --> 00:16:35.404
Stay vigilant.
At the slightest move, sound the alert.

95
00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:36.614
Yes, Sir!

96
00:16:36.656 --> 00:16:37.739
Sprink!

97
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.408
Come with me.

98
00:16:41.409 --> 00:16:43.035
Yes, Sir!

99
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.329
Attention all!

100
00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:51.791
Deposit the enemy weapons
in the Friedrichsstrasse trench!

101
00:16:52.917 --> 00:16:55.335
Go help them.
- Right.

102
00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:04.300
Have to rebuild it.

103
00:17:41.283 --> 00:17:42.951
Relax, no one saw me.

104
00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:52.916
Get hurt?

105
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.961
Christ! What happened?

106
00:17:57.962 --> 00:18:00.546
You were barely 15 mins in there.

107
00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:04.215
Reinforcements didn't...
- Machine gunners in the sap.

108
00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:06.800
Lost a third of my men in 5 mins.

109
00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:08.968
When you saw the Scots retreat
on your left

110
00:18:08.969 --> 00:18:10.637
you gave up on the farm.

111
00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:13.598
So, any word?

112
00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:17.350
I tried the Red Cross, but no go.

113
00:18:18.101 --> 00:18:20.811
No news from the enemy-occupied zone.

114
00:18:22.895 --> 00:18:26.064
The Germans appear to be
treating civilians correctly.

115
00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.360
Your wife is most likely
at her parents' with the baby.

116
00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:40.366
During the shelling,
a faulty canon exploded.

117
00:18:41.492 --> 00:18:44.494
Killed the officer
and his 5 men outright.

118
00:18:45.536 --> 00:18:49.372
I asked you be drafted in
to replace him.

119
00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:53.832
Artillery, a fine corps.
You'll move up fast.

120
00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:54.876
No.

121
00:18:55.793 --> 00:18:58.335
Keep your gunner's career,
I stay here with my men.

122
00:18:58.336 --> 00:19:03.007
Find another Lieutenant, no shortage.

123
00:19:04.508 --> 00:19:07.676
I'm Major General here,
I'll do as I see fit.

124
00:19:08.218 --> 00:19:09.552
You'll do as I say.

125
00:19:12.596 --> 00:19:15.722
I'll let you spend Christmas
in your unit.

126
00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:19.809
Then you go to Poitiers for training.
That's an order.

127
00:19:24.354 --> 00:19:27.439
If you want your visit to remain secret
you'd best leave,

128
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.357
my orderly's coming.

129
00:19:29.358 --> 00:19:31.651
You rest up here for 3 days.

130
00:19:31.692 --> 00:19:34.527
Then, the front line
by the Delsaux farm.

131
00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:36.655
The sector should be quiet
for Christmas.

132
00:19:39.407 --> 00:19:40.533
Get some rest.

133
00:19:41.992 --> 00:19:44.201
See you before you leave for Poitiers.

134
00:19:45.244 --> 00:19:46.244
Goodnight.

135
00:19:47.578 --> 00:19:49.121
Goodnight, Sir.

136
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.546
Lieutenant,
found some blankets for tonight.

137
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.548
What's wrong, Lieutenant?

138
00:20:08.052 --> 00:20:10.885
My wallet! I've lost my wallet.

139
00:20:10.886 --> 00:20:15.180
The wallet with the photo you showed me?

140
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:16.182
Yes.

141
00:20:19.893 --> 00:20:21.477
What a shame...

142
00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:27.106
But you hardly need photos
of your wife's face.

143
00:20:29.232 --> 00:20:31.442
I'd a mishap too.

144
00:20:31.443 --> 00:20:32.860
Look at that, Sir.

145
00:20:34.486 --> 00:20:38.197
Two centimeters higher
and I was a goner!

146
00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.160
And it still rings!

147
00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:50.664
Unstoppable, just like me!
Eh, Lieutenant?

148
00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:06.800
It means placing one every five meters.

149
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:09.635
Every five meters?

150
00:21:12.387 --> 00:21:14.430
How many is that in all?

151
00:21:16.098 --> 00:21:17.891
About 100,000.

152
00:21:19.351 --> 00:21:22.436
Or 20 trains for Lille via Brussels.

153
00:21:22.978 --> 00:21:24.520
Incredible!

154
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:26.522
Christmas trees!

155
00:21:28.773 --> 00:21:34.152
It'll take me longer to send these trees
to the front than our canons.

156
00:21:56.918 --> 00:21:59.044
Show Miss SÃ¶rensen in!

157
00:22:14.347 --> 00:22:15.514
How is he?

158
00:22:18.307 --> 00:22:19.392
Well.

159
00:22:19.933 --> 00:22:25.103
His regiment came under surprise attack
four days ago.

160
00:22:25.104 --> 00:22:27.606
But they drove back the enemy.

161
00:22:29.565 --> 00:22:34.736
As regards your proposal...

162
00:22:36.654 --> 00:22:42.115
I'm afraid to say, I cannot accept it.

163
00:22:42.116 --> 00:22:46.827
As a Dane, I feel the gravity
of the situation escapes you.

164
00:22:47.327 --> 00:22:49.578
For five months now,

165
00:22:49.579 --> 00:22:52.455
two million of our men
have fought unrelenting.

166
00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:59.336
We have neither the time nor the urge
to organize recitals.

167
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.755
It took me a while to realize
I'd approached the wrong person.

168
00:23:03.756 --> 00:23:08.008
So I contacted the Kronprinz,

169
00:23:08.009 --> 00:23:16.889
who'd be delighted to have a recital
at his HQ on Christmas Eve.

170
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.184
I was told you were responsible
not just for canons and convoys,

171
00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:24.186
but also the soldiers.

172
00:23:24.187 --> 00:23:28.773
So if you would kindly sign here,

173
00:23:29.649 --> 00:23:34.527
next to the Kronprinz,
before informing your men.

174
00:23:41.114 --> 00:23:44.617
You'll only see him one night.
What's the point of that?

175
00:23:46.368 --> 00:23:48.495
It'll be much more than one night.

176
00:23:51.414 --> 00:23:54.165
Our minutes are longer than yours.

177
00:24:05.506 --> 00:24:06.841
Mother,

178
00:24:06.882 --> 00:24:10.302
William and I
got your package and letter.

179
00:24:11.094 --> 00:24:13.971
Thanks for the mittens and the mufflers.

180
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.682
It's so cold here, they're most welcome.

181
00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:22.143
The thought of you at home nice and warm
keeps us going!

182
00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:25.270
Thanks for the cake, too.

183
00:24:25.854 --> 00:24:28.896
I hope we have some left
for Christmas Eve.

184
00:24:28.897 --> 00:24:31.942
Your two sons, who love you...

185
00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:33.526
Morning, Father.

186
00:24:35.236 --> 00:24:38.612
3 cases of whisky!
That's a lot of ammunition.

187
00:24:38.613 --> 00:24:40.114
I presume I'm invited?

188
00:24:40.155 --> 00:24:42.574
Sir, my men are completely exhausted.

189
00:24:43.575 --> 00:24:45.617
We're all tired, Gordon.

190
00:24:45.618 --> 00:24:47.202
Every single one of us.

191
00:24:48.078 --> 00:24:50.913
I can bring you no relief
before three days.

192
00:24:51.747 --> 00:24:55.958
And if the Germans do attack tonight
or tomorrow, as they may

193
00:24:56.584 --> 00:24:58.210
you'll just have to deal with it.

194
00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:00.920
Yes Sir.

195
00:25:08.842 --> 00:25:11.301
Our valiant stretcher-bearer.

196
00:25:11.302 --> 00:25:15.387
Who nearly got one of his own men killed
in no-man's -land.

197
00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:19.391
A stretcher-bearer is supposed
to save lives not endanger them.

198
00:25:20.392 --> 00:25:21.934
I gave orders,

199
00:25:21.976 --> 00:25:25.728
very clear orders that it was forbidden
to leave these trenches

200
00:25:25.729 --> 00:25:27.937
in case of a German counter attack.

201
00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:29.106
Yes Sir, but...

202
00:25:29.148 --> 00:25:31.232
But you don't give a damn!

203
00:25:33.276 --> 00:25:36.653
Now I suggest you
drop the St. Bernard act in future

204
00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:38.445
and never forget

205
00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:41.782
something called military discipline!

206
00:25:45.868 --> 00:25:47.411
Understood?

207
00:25:48.577 --> 00:25:50.078
Do you understand?

208
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.329
Yes, Sir.

209
00:25:53.998 --> 00:25:56.083
Can you tell me what you're doing here

210
00:25:56.792 --> 00:25:59.710
in the front line
in the absence of combat?

211
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:01.753
Visiting a friend...

212
00:26:01.796 --> 00:26:02.879
What?

213
00:26:05.298 --> 00:26:06.382
A friend?

214
00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:08.925
Where do you think you are?

215
00:26:09.759 --> 00:26:11.468
Your local parish?

216
00:26:12.469 --> 00:26:15.763
You will return with me immediately
to the back line.

217
00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:22.643
Come on, man! Make yourself useful.

218
00:26:23.185 --> 00:26:24.144
Sir.

219
00:26:25.312 --> 00:26:26.896
This way is shorter.

220
00:26:38.529 --> 00:26:41.655
Take a right through the cludgies,

221
00:26:41.656 --> 00:26:42.990
the latrines.
- This way?

222
00:26:43.032 --> 00:26:45.617
Yes, this way.
- Get me out of here, will you?

223
00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:48.578
Enough.

224
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:52.329
Sorry we have to
go through the cludgies, Sir...

225
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.415
Christ!
- Sniper, Sir!

226
00:26:56.917 --> 00:26:59.042
What a bloody disgusting mess!

227
00:26:59.043 --> 00:27:00.627
Bad place to take a fall, Sir.

228
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:04.046
Get me out of here!
- Absolutely, Sir.

229
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.466
Shut up, will you!

230
00:27:08.925 --> 00:27:11.760
As a priest, I'm used to silence...

231
00:27:12.928 --> 00:27:14.178
That's enough.

232
00:27:15.554 --> 00:27:17.556
Well?
- Nothing.

233
00:27:17.598 --> 00:27:21.725
Just a rifle shot. It's dead calm.

234
00:27:21.726 --> 00:27:26.020
Be wary, they'll stop at nothing,
even on Christmas Eve.

235
00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:31.190
Follow me.

236
00:27:33.359 --> 00:27:35.276
Know who had this brilliant idea?

237
00:27:35.318 --> 00:27:36.236
No.

238
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:39.154
For you, Lieutenant.

239
00:27:49.077 --> 00:27:50.078
Sprink!

240
00:27:52.205 --> 00:27:55.915
You'll be leaving us for one night.

241
00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:59.542
To go where?

242
00:27:59.543 --> 00:28:02.670
Home, in a way,
where you'd be better off.

243
00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:05.839
Why do you dislike me, Sir?

244
00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:15.887
After your regiment was disbanded
I had to take you.

245
00:28:15.888 --> 00:28:19.181
But I prefer masons, bakers, farmers.

246
00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:23.558
Artists like you are a dead loss,

247
00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:25.977
nothing but a millstone.

248
00:28:25.978 --> 00:28:28.855
Now go. This officer's taking you.

249
00:28:46.075 --> 00:28:47.493
Get a move on!

250
00:28:47.535 --> 00:28:49.786
It's 10 o'clock and nothing's done!

251
00:29:02.836 --> 00:29:04.462
Easy on there.

252
00:29:05.505 --> 00:29:06.881
It's not too short?

253
00:29:06.923 --> 00:29:13.427
I told you, Lieutenant,
I'm the best barber in Lens.

254
00:29:13.428 --> 00:29:15.804
Even the mayor used to come to my shop!

255
00:29:18.014 --> 00:29:21.348
And Henri Hennebicque,
was he a customer?

256
00:29:21.349 --> 00:29:25.185
Hennebicque... Doesn't ring a bell.

257
00:29:25.186 --> 00:29:26.478
My father-in-law,

258
00:29:27.103 --> 00:29:30.856
deputy mayor, lives at 21 Cypress Alley.

259
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.274
You never told me.

260
00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:36.694
Cypress Alley, I know it well!

261
00:29:37.444 --> 00:29:40.028
Been a few times to have my bike fixed

262
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:43.364
at Narcisse Denoyelle's, number 43.

263
00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:47.784
Right, I can see it now,
a little blue gate.

264
00:29:53.705 --> 00:29:56.790
I feel I can tell you, now...

265
00:29:56.791 --> 00:30:00.709
Sometimes, of an evening,
I head up along the embankment

266
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:05.004
towards the farm, softly softly,
so not to get killed.

267
00:30:08.424 --> 00:30:12.509
I sit down and I look...

268
00:30:13.219 --> 00:30:15.470
I know the Delsaux farm well.

269
00:30:16.012 --> 00:30:19.431
I'd cycle there for eggs and milk.

270
00:30:20.807 --> 00:30:26.561
Just beyond the farm
is the road to Lens.

271
00:30:27.187 --> 00:30:28.730
Straight to Lens.

272
00:30:33.132 --> 00:30:37.218
On foot, I'd be home in an hour.

273
00:30:38.011 --> 00:30:39.219
No bother,

274
00:30:40.678 --> 00:30:41.762
one hour!

275
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.140
My mother would be waiting at the door,

276
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:50.184
a full pot of coffee on the stove,

277
00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:53.519
just like before...

278
00:31:02.274 --> 00:31:04.901
What a nuisance, these damn lice!

279
00:31:08.404 --> 00:31:09.571
There you go.

280
00:31:10.946 --> 00:31:14.115
I think I'm done, Lieutenant.

281
00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:18.910
Well?

282
00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:21.162
Ponchel,

283
00:31:22.663 --> 00:31:24.414
there's no mirror in front!

284
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:28.081
Christ, what an idiot!

285
00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:34.210
But you're grand, Sir,
tip-top for the party tonight.

286
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:36.296
If you say so!
- I do...

287
00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:42.215
Welcome, Miss.

288
00:31:42.257 --> 00:31:43.716
My pleasure.

289
00:31:43.758 --> 00:31:44.926
This way, please.

290
00:31:54.723 --> 00:31:57.016
Miss SÃ¶renson, most honored.

291
00:32:03.061 --> 00:32:07.522
I will not tolerate mistakes!
Clean that up at once!

292
00:32:13.233 --> 00:32:17.195
Know where Nikolaus Sprink is?

293
00:32:19.655 --> 00:32:22.448
Know where Nikolaus Sprink is?

294
00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:24.282
He arrived about an hour ago.

295
00:32:24.324 --> 00:32:26.450
Sprink? The tenor?

296
00:32:26.451 --> 00:32:27.284
Yes.

297
00:32:27.367 --> 00:32:31.119
Miss, though we've owned this house
for 300 years,

298
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.663
it is no longer our home
since September 23 last.

299
00:32:34.664 --> 00:32:36.998
Ask elsewhere, if you would.

300
00:32:37.582 --> 00:32:42.710
With any taste they'll have put him
in my room on the top floor.

301
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:43.795
Thank you.

302
00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:48.046
You poor thing! Good taste indeed!

303
00:32:49.339 --> 00:32:54.926
Prussians with taste!
You shouldn't even answer those people.

304
00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:25.361
No! I have lice.

305
00:35:17.846 --> 00:35:20.847
We'll sing again together,
just like before.

306
00:35:22.265 --> 00:35:24.308
I am not like before, Anna.

307
00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:34.940
Sing for me! Sing for us!

308
00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:12.671
Your Highness.

309
00:36:16.422 --> 00:36:20.300
I'm glad to see the war has spared you.

310
00:36:21.426 --> 00:36:26.261
That you volunteered as a private,

311
00:36:26.262 --> 00:36:28.680
was most impressive.

312
00:36:29.722 --> 00:36:32.556
I did not volunteer.

313
00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:35.392
I was called up like all the others.

314
00:36:38.478 --> 00:36:43.563
I congratulate you
on your initiative, Miss.

315
00:36:43.564 --> 00:36:48.650
It takes a woman to remind us
that despite the war, it is Christmas.

316
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.693
Thanks to you and your voices,

317
00:36:52.694 --> 00:36:55.238
tonight shall feel just like Berlin,

318
00:36:55.946 --> 00:36:58.615
where I hope to return
as soon as possible.

319
00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:01.868
Perhaps next spring,

320
00:37:02.784 --> 00:37:05.244
if all goes to plan.

321
00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:08.037
Next spring!

322
00:39:55.848 --> 00:39:57.181
You smoke?

323
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.811
Everyone smokes in the trenches.

324
00:40:06.395 --> 00:40:09.063
You kill time as you can.

325
00:40:12.482 --> 00:40:16.360
It's five years today since we met.

326
00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:20.328
Oslo...

327
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:24.914
Five years already?

328
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.958
To have to brush with death
to realize how time flies.

329
00:40:31.959 --> 00:40:33.501
That's the terrible thing.

330
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:42.298
All these fat, sated men parading,
swilling Champagne.

331
00:40:47.217 --> 00:40:49.385
Anna, I must return to the front...

332
00:40:51.053 --> 00:40:53.387
to sing for my comrades.

333
00:40:54.305 --> 00:40:55.639
Tonight, above all.

334
00:40:55.722 --> 00:40:59.389
For months I've dreamt of this
and you want to go?

335
00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.224
I don't want to leave you,

336
00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:04.769
but I must go sing for them.

337
00:41:05.394 --> 00:41:07.228
I'll return afterwards.

338
00:41:08.352 --> 00:41:09.312
I'll come too.

339
00:41:09.395 --> 00:41:11.021
Out of the question!

340
00:41:11.647 --> 00:41:15.316
It's too dangerous. You don't realize.

341
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.693
When you left,

342
00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:22.693
not a second passed without my wondering
if you were still alive.

343
00:41:22.694 --> 00:41:26.905
You are and I am with you.
Nothing else matters.

344
00:41:29.199 --> 00:41:32.241
I've too long awaited this night.

345
00:41:32.908 --> 00:41:35.701
I'll not lose a single instant.

346
00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:42.871
And without my pass from the Kaiser
you'll not get far.

347
00:41:44.581 --> 00:41:47.124
You have a pass from the Kaiser?

348
00:41:51.168 --> 00:41:54.294
The Major General places
his trust in you.

349
00:42:00.256 --> 00:42:01.715
Hell, Lieutenant!

350
00:42:01.756 --> 00:42:04.591
Couldn't they leave us be
on Christmas Eve?

351
00:42:04.592 --> 00:42:07.258
The dirty work always falls to the same!

352
00:42:07.259 --> 00:42:08.927
I volunteer to go.

353
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.971
I want no trouble, Gueusselin.

354
00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:17.555
Approach their lines,
recce the machine guns and back.

355
00:42:17.556 --> 00:42:18.640
Understood?

356
00:42:18.724 --> 00:42:22.727
With this moonlight
can I return fire if spotted?

357
00:42:23.643 --> 00:42:26.437
Stealth and speed
if you want a hot meal.

358
00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:47.406
Hey lads, where'd you get the pipes?

359
00:42:48.907 --> 00:42:51.200
Where'd you get the pipes?
- I found it.

360
00:42:51.242 --> 00:42:54.743
The guys in 92nd heard
we'd be in the trenches for Christmas.

361
00:42:54.744 --> 00:42:58.411
That was decent!
Don't suppose there's a spare set?

362
00:42:58.912 --> 00:43:00.997
Sit here, you can use mine.

363
00:43:01.831 --> 00:43:03.499
Padre, give us a song.

364
00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:06.791
I'm dreaming of home?

365
00:44:18.328 --> 00:44:20.080
Come boys, louder!

366
00:45:16.276 --> 00:45:18.528
They seem to be having fun.

367
00:45:20.029 --> 00:45:21.780
Wouldn't you like to as well?

368
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:24.571
This is Anna SÃ¶rensen.

369
00:45:24.572 --> 00:45:26.531
Good evening.

370
00:45:28.116 --> 00:45:29.158
Good evening.

371
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.326
What's all this?

372
00:45:31.535 --> 00:45:34.162
Are you mad bringing this lady here?

373
00:45:34.204 --> 00:45:35.828
Lieutenant,

374
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:40.872
I convinced the Kronprinz
that a little music would do no harm.

375
00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:44.917
Very well.

376
00:45:46.001 --> 00:45:47.501
Fire away.

377
00:46:23.229 --> 00:46:24.312
Lieutenant!

378
00:46:25.188 --> 00:46:28.857
Come quickly, something odd is afoot.

379
00:46:35.735 --> 00:46:37.527
I don't like this, Lieutenant.

380
00:46:38.945 --> 00:46:41.697
Could be a diversion
for some dirty trick.

381
00:48:31.055 --> 00:48:32.097
Sprink.

382
00:48:36.515 --> 00:48:37.640
Get down!

383
00:51:03.755 --> 00:51:05.673
Good evening, Englishmen!

384
00:51:05.715 --> 00:51:07.007
Good evening Germans,

385
00:51:07.049 --> 00:51:09.384
but we're not English! We're Scottish!

386
00:51:16.928 --> 00:51:19.846
Very nice, but that's enough.

387
00:51:21.512 --> 00:51:23.388
This is not the Berlin opera.

388
00:51:24.472 --> 00:51:25.597
You're right.

389
00:51:27.223 --> 00:51:29.349
It's better than Berlin.

390
00:51:32.307 --> 00:51:36.307
Well I never! That beats the lot...

391
00:51:36.308 --> 00:51:39.267
A summit meeting
and we're not even invited!

392
00:51:39.268 --> 00:51:40.728
Shut it, Ponchel!

393
00:51:41.479 --> 00:51:43.105
What the hell's going on?

394
00:51:58.985 --> 00:52:00.567
Good evening.

395
00:52:00.609 --> 00:52:02.110
Do you speak English?

396
00:52:02.776 --> 00:52:04.487
Yes... a little.

397
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.777
Wonderful.

398
00:52:06.778 --> 00:52:09.697
We've been talking about a ceasefire

399
00:52:10.906 --> 00:52:13.905
for Christmas Eve. What do you think?

400
00:52:20.325 --> 00:52:22.826
The outcome of this war
won't be decided tonight.

401
00:52:23.784 --> 00:52:27.703
No one would criticize us for
laying down our rifles on Christmas Eve.

402
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.287
Don't worry, it is just for tonight.

403
00:52:31.997 --> 00:52:34.329
What the devil are they up to?

404
00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:36.289
Maybe the Germans are fed up.

405
00:52:37.289 --> 00:52:39.249
They want to surrender.

406
00:52:41.332 --> 00:52:42.500
I doubt it.

407
00:52:45.668 --> 00:52:48.252
Give me a bottle of champagne
and my beaker.

408
00:52:53.461 --> 00:52:54.420
Thank you.

409
00:52:57.838 --> 00:52:58.881
Thank you.

410
00:53:06.842 --> 00:53:08.092
Merry Christmas!

411
00:53:09.217 --> 00:53:10.426
Merry Christmas!

412
00:53:10.968 --> 00:53:12.135
Merry Christmas!

413
00:53:28.391 --> 00:53:30.184
What idiot did...

414
00:54:10.198 --> 00:54:11.365
Merry Christmas!

415
00:55:00.215 --> 00:55:02.133
Good evening, I'm Anna.

416
00:55:24.474 --> 00:55:26.434
You first... Go ahead.

417
00:55:41.397 --> 00:55:46.149
Felix! Where have you been?

418
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:50.692
No, his name is not Felix, it's Nestor.

419
00:55:50.693 --> 00:55:53.192
It's Felix...
- No, Nestor.

420
00:55:53.193 --> 00:55:58.652
It's the cat from the Delsaux farm.
No, I know better than you.

421
00:55:58.653 --> 00:56:00.529
It's Felix...
- No, Nestor.

422
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:02.571
Here, I've had enough.

423
00:56:02.572 --> 00:56:04.862
It's Felix...
- No, Nestor.

424
00:56:04.863 --> 00:56:12.283
See? It's Nestor.
- It's Felix.

425
00:56:12.284 --> 00:56:15.867
Nestor's heading for the French side.

426
00:56:17.617 --> 00:56:18.785
My wife.

427
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.248
A pretty girl.
- Very.

428
00:56:31.165 --> 00:56:33.041
This is my wife.

429
00:56:51.631 --> 00:56:52.840
Montparnasse...

430
00:56:53.923 --> 00:56:56.466
That's my wife's favorite part
in Paris.

431
00:56:57.508 --> 00:56:59.175
The Luxemburg Gardens.

432
00:57:00.218 --> 00:57:02.718
Got a picture of your wife?

433
00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:06.719
Like you, I had a photo of her, but...

434
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.887
I lost it.

435
00:57:10.304 --> 00:57:12.097
I've drawn her face, but...

436
00:57:13.306 --> 00:57:15.138
it's not really the same.

437
00:57:27.392 --> 00:57:30.061
Do you live on Rue Vavin?

438
00:57:32.813 --> 00:57:33.813
Yes.

439
00:57:39.063 --> 00:57:40.231
I think...

440
00:57:42.233 --> 00:57:46.275
I find your wallet in my trench,
the night of the assault.

441
00:57:47.026 --> 00:57:48.900
I kept it because of the address.

442
00:57:55.613 --> 00:57:57.863
A little hotel on Rue Vavin.

443
00:58:01.239 --> 00:58:04.948
Spent a week there with my wife,
two years ago.

444
00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.617
For our honeymoon.

445
00:58:11.285 --> 00:58:12.784
Thank you.

446
00:58:13.409 --> 00:58:14.494
You're welcome.

447
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:22.329
Hold on, that's Gueusselin's bottle!

448
00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:24.163
Who cares, he's turned in.

449
00:58:24.205 --> 00:58:25.372
I doubt it.

450
00:58:25.831 --> 00:58:30.334
Thank you, very much... Sirs.

451
00:58:42.755 --> 00:58:43.922
It's good!

452
00:58:46.213 --> 00:58:49.130
How many months pregnant was she there?

453
00:58:49.131 --> 00:58:50.298
Five months.

454
00:58:51.674 --> 00:58:53.550
That was in Lens, at her parents'

455
00:58:55.218 --> 00:58:56.511
last July...

456
00:58:57.801 --> 00:59:02.719
Then there were complications,
she was confined to bed...

457
00:59:03.428 --> 00:59:07.514
I asked to stay by her side, but no go.

458
00:59:11.972 --> 00:59:14.932
Called to war, I'd to leave her there.

459
00:59:15.807 --> 00:59:20.684
But... Don't you write?

460
00:59:20.685 --> 00:59:21.975
How is she?

461
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.268
I've had no letters since September.

462
00:59:26.269 --> 00:59:28.521
The front is impassable.

463
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.688
I don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl.

464
01:01:06.806 --> 01:01:08.306
I abandoned you.

465
01:01:09.807 --> 01:01:11.516
I abandoned you here.

466
01:01:14.683 --> 01:01:15.850
Hey, Scotsman!

467
01:01:16.643 --> 01:01:18.935
Don't go for the piety either?

468
01:01:19.769 --> 01:01:22.393
The French gave me some champagne.

469
01:01:22.394 --> 01:01:23.520
Like some?

470
01:01:27.904 --> 01:01:28.905
Come.

471
01:02:21.627 --> 01:02:23.084
Sing for us.

472
01:02:26.795 --> 01:02:28.045
Sing for them.

473
01:06:25.688 --> 01:06:27.230
Good evening, gentlemen.

474
01:07:25.079 --> 01:07:26.913
Please... Make way.

475
01:07:26.955 --> 01:07:28.788
Thank you, thank you.

476
01:07:31.662 --> 01:07:32.871
You were wonderful.

477
01:07:35.247 --> 01:07:38.372
I'm Jewish.
Christmas means nothing to me.

478
01:07:38.373 --> 01:07:41.500
But I'll never forget tonight.

479
01:07:42.498 --> 01:07:43.540
Thank you.

480
01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:49.710
So what about the young lady?

481
01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:52.001
Yes, I wanted to ask you.

482
01:07:52.002 --> 01:07:55.959
Could she spend the night
in your shelter?

483
01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.962
I meant: when is she leaving?

484
01:07:59.295 --> 01:08:01.337
Tomorrow morning.

485
01:08:01.338 --> 01:08:02.338
Fine.

486
01:08:04.256 --> 01:08:06.877
Alas, you cannot sleep in my shelter.

487
01:08:06.878 --> 01:08:08.421
I have company.

488
01:08:10.131 --> 01:08:14.423
A big rat, for 3 days now,
but I'll get him in the end.

489
01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.715
We'll find a solution.

490
01:08:16.756 --> 01:08:18.798
Good night, Lieutenant.

491
01:08:18.799 --> 01:08:20.675
Good night.

492
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:27.010
Don't worry, Miss.

493
01:08:27.011 --> 01:08:29.675
I'll find you a safe place.

494
01:08:29.676 --> 01:08:30.885
Thanks, JÃ¶rg.

495
01:08:33.928 --> 01:08:35.679
So, Lieutenant,

496
01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.639
what did you put in your report for HQ?

497
01:08:39.306 --> 01:08:42.762
I wrote: 24th of December, 1914:

498
01:08:43.472 --> 01:08:45.848
no hostilities
on the German side tonight.

499
01:08:47.599 --> 01:08:49.226
Well, that's the truth.

500
01:08:52.725 --> 01:08:54.016
Tonight,

501
01:08:55.516 --> 01:08:59.978
these men were drawn to that altar
like a fire in the middle of winter.

502
01:09:01.894 --> 01:09:05.436
Even those who aren't devout
came to warm themselves.

503
01:09:08.154 --> 01:09:09.905
Maybe just to be together.

504
01:09:13.488 --> 01:09:15.988
Maybe to forget about the war.

505
01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:19.156
Maybe...

506
01:09:22.571 --> 01:09:24.490
But the war won't forget us!

507
01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:03.160
Merry Christmas.

508
01:10:21.289 --> 01:10:23.329
Oskar!

509
01:10:24.289 --> 01:10:26.872
Oskar!

510
01:10:38.748 --> 01:10:42.331
Listen. Someone's digging out there.

511
01:10:42.332 --> 01:10:45.332
Mines! Those damn Scots
are digging a mine sap!

512
01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:49.750
They'll fill it with explosives
and blow us sky high.

513
01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:55.750
No, they're not digging any sap.

514
01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:59.583
They are, I tell you!

515
01:10:59.584 --> 01:11:01.418
You just got too pally with them
last night.

516
01:11:01.459 --> 01:11:02.542
Yeah?

517
01:11:03.751 --> 01:11:06.419
Look who's talking!
- Look!

518
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:17.586
Jonathan, come with me.

519
01:11:19.795 --> 01:11:20.920
Jonathan.

520
01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:23.837
Dale!

521
01:11:25.128 --> 01:11:26.129
Dale!

522
01:11:26.921 --> 01:11:30.878
What the hell are you doing?
The truce is over.

523
01:11:30.879 --> 01:11:32.671
Any minute the Germans
will start shooting,

524
01:11:32.712 --> 01:11:34.797
get back in the trench!

525
01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:35.838
Now!

526
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:43.798
Get back down!

527
01:11:44.464 --> 01:11:45.465
Down!

528
01:11:52.257 --> 01:11:54.132
Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning.

529
01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:59.300
Is it possible that we officers
talk about the dead?

530
01:12:00.634 --> 01:12:01.634
The dead?

531
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.841
Ponchel!

532
01:12:07.175 --> 01:12:08.634
Bring your coffee!

533
01:12:26.179 --> 01:12:27.220
Thank you.

534
01:12:32.845 --> 01:12:33.845
Thank you.

535
01:12:48.222 --> 01:12:51.348
Thanks, Ponchel. You can leave us now.

536
01:12:57.266 --> 01:13:01.015
My men will remove the bodies
of the men killed last week,

537
01:13:01.016 --> 01:13:02.724
so you can bury them.

538
01:13:04.265 --> 01:13:06.558
And we will return the remains
of your men

539
01:13:06.599 --> 01:13:09.059
who fell in front of our lines
last November.

540
01:13:10.017 --> 01:13:11.268
That makes sense.

541
01:13:12.269 --> 01:13:14.684
Burying the dead
on the day Christ was born.

542
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.309
That makes sense.

543
01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:19.935
Yes.

544
01:13:28.686 --> 01:13:30.019
I'm fast.

545
01:13:31.019 --> 01:13:35.478
Sorry, but why does an alarm
go off every morning at ten o'clock?

546
01:13:35.479 --> 01:13:36.896
Changing of the guard?

547
01:13:36.938 --> 01:13:37.979
No,

548
01:13:38.021 --> 01:13:42.770
my aide-de-camp used to have coffee
every morning at ten, with his mother.

549
01:13:43.187 --> 01:13:46.229
He's worried he'll
forget about all that with the war.

550
01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:48.480
We've just got used to it.

551
01:13:49.147 --> 01:13:50.314
So have we.

552
01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:54.197
Need a hand?

553
01:15:42.409 --> 01:15:43.201
GOD IS WITH US

554
01:15:43.284 --> 01:15:44.993
Can you come, Father?

555
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:16.046
In a few days, their families,

556
01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:20.715
their wives,
will receive the terrible news...

557
01:17:24.132 --> 01:17:26.380
What we'd rather not think about.

558
01:17:29.341 --> 01:17:32.800
For them,
nothing will ever be the same again.

559
01:17:37.725 --> 01:17:38.850
You too,

560
01:17:40.974 --> 01:17:45.558
one day they'll cover you
and dump you in a hole.

561
01:17:48.724 --> 01:17:51.974
Let us go, while there's still time.

562
01:17:51.975 --> 01:17:54.265
I have my pass, Holland is not far.

563
01:17:54.266 --> 01:17:57.432
It is at peace, we'd have a future.

564
01:17:57.433 --> 01:18:00.431
Impossible! That'd be to desert.

565
01:18:00.432 --> 01:18:04.055
It's not desertion,
it's staying together.

566
01:18:04.056 --> 01:18:07.098
I'm a soldier. Like all the others.

567
01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.601
I have duties, like everyone here.

568
01:18:11.263 --> 01:18:13.139
Holland is quite a way.

569
01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:17.099
We'd get caught. Even with your pass.

570
01:18:18.348 --> 01:18:20.724
There's another solution.

571
01:18:21.805 --> 01:18:26.138
The French border is 100 m away.
We only have to cross it.

572
01:18:27.055 --> 01:18:30.723
I've made tea. Perhaps you'd like some.

573
01:18:31.598 --> 01:18:32.599
Come.

574
01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:35.972
Come.

575
01:18:54.305 --> 01:18:55.515
By the way...

576
01:18:57.013 --> 01:18:59.805
The others asked me
to give you these letters.

577
01:19:00.971 --> 01:19:04.846
We don't trust the military post

578
01:19:04.847 --> 01:19:08.845
and as you're going back to Berlin,
we thought...

579
01:19:10.263 --> 01:19:11.472
Sure.

580
01:19:30.553 --> 01:19:31.845
Come on, Morallec!

581
01:19:32.761 --> 01:19:33.720
Go for it!

582
01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:51.761
Looks like trouble for the Jerries.

583
01:20:02.052 --> 01:20:04.635
I heard last night, about your wife...

584
01:20:07.175 --> 01:20:08.801
If you like...

585
01:20:09.802 --> 01:20:12.179
I can get a letter through to her.

586
01:20:13.425 --> 01:20:17.135
Why would you do that?
If you got caught...

587
01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:23.093
One letter won't stop us
winning the war!

588
01:20:23.927 --> 01:20:29.217
And anyhow when we'll have taken Paris,
and it's over,

589
01:20:29.218 --> 01:20:32.634
you can invite us for a drink
in Rue Vavin.

590
01:20:33.675 --> 01:20:36.844
You don't have to invade Paris
to drop round for a drink.

591
01:20:40.342 --> 01:20:44.467
How many cartridges
have you to fire per day?

592
01:20:45.384 --> 01:20:46.300
How many?

593
01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:48.926
Ah, eight!

594
01:20:48.968 --> 01:20:50.549
What?
- Eight.

595
01:20:52.884 --> 01:20:55.298
Oh, eight.

596
01:20:55.299 --> 01:20:56.758
And you?

597
01:20:56.799 --> 01:20:58.592
Seven
- Seven?

598
01:20:58.893 --> 01:21:00.933
Seven and eight.

599
01:21:00.934 --> 01:21:04.015
Us, five! Doesn't surprise me!

600
01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:08.887
Yesterday, William managed
to bag two Jerries

601
01:21:08.888 --> 01:21:11.513
who'd been sniping at us for hours.

602
01:21:11.514 --> 01:21:12.596
If he keeps this up,

603
01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.055
he'll qualify as the best shot
in the whole platoon.

604
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:19.844
All our mates
have their eyes on your cake,

605
01:21:19.845 --> 01:21:22.804
but William and I
are guarding it closely.

606
01:21:23.804 --> 01:21:26.968
Lots of love from both of us.

607
01:21:38.425 --> 01:21:42.047
Still here? Weren't they sending a car?

608
01:21:42.048 --> 01:21:46.213
We waited, but no one came for her.

609
01:21:46.214 --> 01:21:49.755
I guess the party dragged on at HQ,
they're not awake yet.

610
01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:01.336
HQ called me 5 minutes ago.

611
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.085
They told me you'd vanished.

612
01:22:05.042 --> 01:22:08.001
They thought you'd deserted, Sprink.

613
01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:12.000
I told them you were here
with Miss SÃ¶rensen,

614
01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:15.289
that you came to sing for your comrades.

615
01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:18.498
That really impressed them!

616
01:22:18.499 --> 01:22:22.916
I was asked to keep an eye on you
till they arrive.

617
01:22:24.079 --> 01:22:26.830
Miss SÃ¶rensen will return to Berlin

618
01:22:27.996 --> 01:22:30.579
and you will be put under arrest.

619
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:33.579
Two weeks.

620
01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:36.411
For disobedience on the front.

621
01:22:38.369 --> 01:22:40.452
Disobedience?

622
01:22:41.369 --> 01:22:43.618
I'm not sure I understand?

623
01:22:44.367 --> 01:22:47.033
So what's the plan for tomorrow?

624
01:22:47.034 --> 01:22:49.242
A little football match

625
01:22:49.243 --> 01:22:52.698
and an aperitif
with those across the way?

626
01:22:53.824 --> 01:22:58.864
Or will you shoot them like rabbits
having shared champagne?

627
01:22:59.947 --> 01:23:02.196
Well, Lieutenant?

628
01:23:03.071 --> 01:23:05.322
All that is now meaningless.

629
01:23:05.364 --> 01:23:07.820
To die tomorrow
is even more absurd than yesterday.

630
01:23:07.821 --> 01:23:09.613
That'll do, Sprink!

631
01:23:14.818 --> 01:23:16.111
Any coffee left?

632
01:23:17.652 --> 01:23:18.902
Felix!

633
01:23:19.985 --> 01:23:23.065
Damn that cat!

634
01:23:23.066 --> 01:23:26.984
Here, Nestor!

635
01:23:40.522 --> 01:23:42.271
Is the French Lieutenant here?

636
01:23:42.612 --> 01:23:45.362
Yes, he just arrived.

637
01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:47.694
What're you doing here?

638
01:23:47.735 --> 01:23:49.735
We said each to their own camp.

639
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.068
I know, but...

640
01:23:55.274 --> 01:23:58.024
Our artillery will shell you
in 10 minutes.

641
01:23:58.775 --> 01:24:02.729
So I suggest you come shelter
in my trench.

642
01:24:17.222 --> 01:24:20.346
Had you been relieved,
I'd not have warned your successors.

643
01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:24.594
They would have shot you first anyway.

644
01:24:25.135 --> 01:24:26.553
Par for the course!

645
01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:45.711
Not a word, Sprink!

646
01:25:26.277 --> 01:25:27.651
Bull's-eye!

647
01:25:30.026 --> 01:25:31.108
Sorry.

648
01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:34.733
Damn! Have to rebuild it all over!

649
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:49.391
By the way...

650
01:25:50.682 --> 01:25:54.099
That letter for my wife...

651
01:26:07.465 --> 01:26:08.633
We've ceased fire.

652
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:12.132
It's time for you to go back.

653
01:26:12.173 --> 01:26:14.172
Hope you both make it through the war.

654
01:26:14.923 --> 01:26:16.671
I don't think it's over yet.

655
01:26:17.296 --> 01:26:21.045
I wouldn't be surprised if our own
artillery opened fire after your attack.

656
01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:24.085
Par for the course!

657
01:27:06.284 --> 01:27:09.448
This time, we leave it at that.

658
01:27:13.571 --> 01:27:15.611
It was nice knowing you.

659
01:27:17.401 --> 01:27:22.397
Perhaps, in other circumstances,
we could have...

660
01:27:22.897 --> 01:27:24.480
Perhaps...

661
01:27:26.355 --> 01:27:29.975
Yet maybe a drink in Rue Vavin,
as a tourist!

662
01:27:31.184 --> 01:27:32.225
Yeh.

663
01:27:33.306 --> 01:27:36.930
That would be smashing!
Is that how you say?

664
01:27:36.931 --> 01:27:37.973
Right.

665
01:27:38.555 --> 01:27:41.092
Your French beats my German.

666
01:27:41.675 --> 01:27:45.258
No merit in that.
Your wife is not German.

667
01:27:49.672 --> 01:27:50.838
Well...

668
01:27:52.337 --> 01:27:53.336
Good luck.

669
01:27:53.378 --> 01:27:54.583
You too.

670
01:27:57.084 --> 01:28:02.164
Goodbye.
- Good luck.

671
01:28:14.115 --> 01:28:16.652
Goodbye.
- Good luck.

672
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:18.901
Right boys!

673
01:28:55.128 --> 01:28:56.170
Lieutenant,

674
01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:02.830
I managed earlier
to recce their machine guns.

675
01:29:03.622 --> 01:29:05.037
All there.

676
01:29:15.779 --> 01:29:16.821
JÃ¶rg...

677
01:29:53.422 --> 01:29:55.506
What are you doing here?

678
01:29:56.337 --> 01:29:58.503
We want you to take us prisoner.

679
01:29:58.545 --> 01:30:01.956
Prisoner? That's not possible!

680
01:30:03.416 --> 01:30:06.497
How do I explain your presence
to my superiors?

681
01:30:07.248 --> 01:30:09.078
I can't do that!

682
01:30:09.079 --> 01:30:11.824
Go back to your trenches,
playtime's over.

683
01:30:14.417 --> 01:30:15.459
Sir,

684
01:30:16.872 --> 01:30:19.538
if we return to the German side
they'll separate us.

685
01:30:22.742 --> 01:30:26.405
Put us in whatever jail you like,
but let us be together,

686
01:30:27.862 --> 01:30:29.196
I beg of you.

687
01:30:34.606 --> 01:30:36.937
Couturier.
- Yes, Sir?

688
01:30:36.938 --> 01:30:39.350
Take these two to the rear,
to the village.

689
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.013
They're prisoners.
Put them in the schoolroom,

690
01:30:44.014 --> 01:30:45.595
I'll bunk elsewhere.

691
01:30:45.637 --> 01:30:48.215
And stay with them, we're back tomorrow.

692
01:30:48.216 --> 01:30:49.300
Lieutenant!

693
01:30:50.632 --> 01:30:53.422
Can you give these to the Red Cross?

694
01:30:53.424 --> 01:30:54.588
It's important.

695
01:31:07.909 --> 01:31:08.823
Ponchel!

696
01:31:10.528 --> 01:31:11.529
Ponchel!

697
01:31:12.279 --> 01:31:15.525
Where's Ponchel?
Been calling him for the past hour.

698
01:31:15.526 --> 01:31:18.106
Said he was going for nosh, Sir.

699
01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:19.855
Nosh?

700
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:42.540
Dearest, I cling to your memory,

701
01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:45.952
like a climber to his rope,
so not to fall...

702
01:31:45.953 --> 01:31:48.327
The poor guy died between our lines...

703
01:31:48.628 --> 01:31:51.791
Let President PoincarÃ© come take
Lorraine himself for all I care!

704
01:31:51.792 --> 01:31:53.290
Try as we did,

705
01:31:53.331 --> 01:31:56.948
before we knew it, they'd scored six!

706
01:31:56.949 --> 01:32:00.569
They admitted later
that most of them play together

707
01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:02.444
in a Munich club called Bayern...

708
01:32:02.486 --> 01:32:05.063
Never will I forget her voice
in the night...

709
01:32:05.064 --> 01:32:07.395
I stayed in my trench, in peace.

710
01:32:07.396 --> 01:32:09.975
Drink with those bastards?
I'd rather die!

711
01:32:10.809 --> 01:32:12.515
Better trenches, must admit...

712
01:32:12.556 --> 01:32:16.633
The Scots photographer
promised us pictures at New Year's.

713
01:32:16.634 --> 01:32:18.091
Be a chance to get back together...

714
01:32:18.133 --> 01:32:21.708
A Bavarian gave me his address,
to visit when it's over...

715
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:26.537
We and the British decided
to accept the Krauts' invitation.

716
01:32:26.538 --> 01:32:29.243
We'll go spend New Year's Eve with them.

717
01:32:29.244 --> 01:32:32.529
We'll sing that song
the Scots taught us.

718
01:32:33.361 --> 01:32:37.274
And above all, drink to the health
of all those bastards,

719
01:32:37.275 --> 01:32:40.811
who sitting pretty,
sent us here to slug it out!

720
01:32:58.996 --> 01:33:01.120
Come on...

721
01:33:12.146 --> 01:33:13.564
He's all yours now.

722
01:33:33.329 --> 01:33:34.703
Give me some water.

723
01:33:47.394 --> 01:33:50.226
You're being sent back
to your parish in Scotland.

724
01:33:51.515 --> 01:33:54.094
I've brought you your marching orders.

725
01:33:59.797 --> 01:34:03.375
I belong with those who are in pain,
and...

726
01:34:03.376 --> 01:34:04.705
who have lost their faith.

727
01:34:04.748 --> 01:34:06.372
I belong here.

728
01:34:08.162 --> 01:34:10.365
I am very disappointed, you know.

729
01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.858
When you requested permission to
accompany the recruits from your parish,

730
01:34:16.859 --> 01:34:19.148
I personally vouched for you.

731
01:34:21.103 --> 01:34:24.600
But then, when I heard what happened...

732
01:34:25.556 --> 01:34:27.137
I prayed for you.

733
01:34:31.464 --> 01:34:36.458
I sincerely believe
that Our Lord Jesus Christ guided me

734
01:34:37.291 --> 01:34:41.118
in what was the most important mass
of my life.

735
01:34:43.698 --> 01:34:47.111
I tried to be true to His trust

736
01:34:48.027 --> 01:34:52.729
and carry His message to all,
whoever they may be.

737
01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:56.389
Those men who listened to you
on Christmas Eve

738
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:59.843
will very soon bitterly regret it.

739
01:35:00.044 --> 01:35:01.670
Because in a few days' time

740
01:35:01.712 --> 01:35:06.494
their regiment is to be disbanded
by order of His Majesty the King.

741
01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:12.027
Where will those poor boys end up
on the front line now?

742
01:35:12.568 --> 01:35:15.522
And what will their families think?

743
01:35:15.523 --> 01:35:18.517
Excuse me, Your Grace.
The boys are ready.

744
01:35:18.518 --> 01:35:19.558
Yes.

745
01:35:21.887 --> 01:35:24.633
They're waiting for me,
to preach a sermon

746
01:35:24.634 --> 01:35:29.000
to the soldiers replacing those
who went astray with you.

747
01:35:31.497 --> 01:35:35.657
May our Lord Jesus Christ
guide your steps back

748
01:35:35.658 --> 01:35:37.863
to the straight and narrow path.

749
01:35:39.778 --> 01:35:42.980
Is that truly the path of our Lord?

750
01:35:47.058 --> 01:35:49.345
You're not asking the right question.

751
01:35:50.428 --> 01:35:51.801
Think about this:

752
01:35:52.923 --> 01:35:58.790
are you really suitable to remain
among us, in the house of our Lord?

753
01:36:33.696 --> 01:36:35.279
Christ our Lord said:

754
01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.062
Think not that I come
to bring peace on Earth.

755
01:36:38.063 --> 01:36:42.307
I come not to bring peace, but a sword.

756
01:36:43.014 --> 01:36:45.554
The Gospel according to Saint Matthew.

757
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:52.460
Well, my brethren,

758
01:36:52.501 --> 01:36:55.413
the sword of the Lord is in your hands.

759
01:36:55.414 --> 01:36:59.948
You are the very defenders
of civilization itself.

760
01:36:59.949 --> 01:37:03.941
The forces of good
against the forces of evil.

761
01:37:04.983 --> 01:37:11.430
For this war is indeed a crusade,

762
01:37:12.011 --> 01:37:14.425
a holy war

763
01:37:14.426 --> 01:37:18.211
to save the freedom of the world.

764
01:37:18.670 --> 01:37:20.500
In truth, I tell you,

765
01:37:22.041 --> 01:37:24.324
the Germans do not act like us,

766
01:37:24.325 --> 01:37:26.489
neither do they think like us,

767
01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:29.072
for they are not, like us,

768
01:37:29.654 --> 01:37:31.733
children of God.

769
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:39.595
Are those who shell cities populated
only by civilians,

770
01:37:39.596 --> 01:37:42.051
the children of God?

771
01:37:42.052 --> 01:37:45.711
Are those who advance armed,

772
01:37:45.712 --> 01:37:49.788
hiding behind women and children,

773
01:37:49.789 --> 01:37:51.952
the children of God?

774
01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:56.320
With God's help,

775
01:37:57.318 --> 01:38:00.646
you must kill the Germans,

776
01:38:00.647 --> 01:38:04.516
good or bad, young or old.

777
01:38:04.517 --> 01:38:07.013
Kill every one of them,

778
01:38:08.261 --> 01:38:11.797
so it won't have to be done again.

779
01:38:15.625 --> 01:38:17.914
The Lord be with you!

780
01:38:17.915 --> 01:38:19.492
And also with you!

781
01:38:19.577 --> 01:38:22.156
May God Almighty bless you,

782
01:38:22.157 --> 01:38:26.816
the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.

783
01:38:27.117 --> 01:38:29.695
Amen.

784
01:38:46.203 --> 01:38:47.990
Everyone to their posts!

785
01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:49.863
Every man to his post!

786
01:38:49.905 --> 01:38:50.945
Quickly!

787
01:38:53.150 --> 01:38:54.975
No, stay here!

788
01:38:54.976 --> 01:38:58.676
What're you doing? Come back!

789
01:38:59.633 --> 01:39:03.124
What the hell are you doing?
Shoot the bloody Kraut!

790
01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:04.500
What are you waiting for?

791
01:39:04.542 --> 01:39:07.285
Shoot him, goddammit! Holidays are over!

792
01:39:12.318 --> 01:39:15.270
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

793
01:39:15.645 --> 01:39:16.934
Shoot him!

794
01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.050
Shoot him!

795
01:39:26.748 --> 01:39:28.784
Stand down from your posts.

796
01:39:35.563 --> 01:39:37.392
Shame on you, Gordon.

797
01:39:38.764 --> 01:39:40.134
Shame on you.

798
01:40:06.125 --> 01:40:09.117
Be silly to die
disguised as a German, eh Sir?

799
01:40:12.122 --> 01:40:13.701
What the devil were you doing?

800
01:40:16.857 --> 01:40:18.936
I had a German help me...

801
01:40:22.634 --> 01:40:24.089
Saw my mother.

802
01:40:26.582 --> 01:40:28.824
We drank a coffee, just like before.

803
01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:33.937
You have a son.

804
01:40:37.095 --> 01:40:38.842
Henri, his name is...

805
01:41:46.246 --> 01:41:47.782
How did you let yourself...

806
01:41:47.824 --> 01:41:49.569
If you came to preach, leave now!

807
01:41:49.610 --> 01:41:52.395
Don't you realize the gravity of this?

808
01:41:52.853 --> 01:41:55.886
It's high treason! Punishable by death.

809
01:41:57.298 --> 01:41:59.833
Only, we can't execute 200 men.

810
01:42:00.499 --> 01:42:01.829
That's all that saves you.

811
01:42:03.369 --> 01:42:07.190
Not counting all the other cases
of fraternization reported since.

812
01:42:07.814 --> 01:42:09.683
If public opinion hears of this...

813
01:42:10.266 --> 01:42:13.962
Have no fear, none here will tell.

814
01:42:14.263 --> 01:42:15.342
I hope not!

815
01:42:15.967 --> 01:42:17.834
Who'd want to! Want to?

816
01:42:17.876 --> 01:42:20.905
The men involved feel no shame.

817
01:42:20.906 --> 01:42:25.182
If they won't tell, it's because
none would believe or understand.

818
01:42:25.183 --> 01:42:29.333
Carousing with the enemy
while the country's partly occupied!

819
01:42:29.334 --> 01:42:33.695
The country? What does it know
of what we suffer here?

820
01:42:34.775 --> 01:42:36.517
Of what we do, without complaint?

821
01:42:37.431 --> 01:42:40.088
Let me tell you,
I felt closer to the Germans

822
01:42:40.089 --> 01:42:43.660
than those who cry Kill the Krauts!
Before their stuffed turkey!

823
01:42:44.573 --> 01:42:46.524
You're talking nonsense.

824
01:42:46.566 --> 01:42:49.763
No, you're just not
living the same war as me.

825
01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:51.257
As those across the way.

826
01:42:53.084 --> 01:42:55.492
You and your men
will rejoin the Verdun sector.

827
01:42:57.611 --> 01:42:59.105
You're right about one thing.

828
01:43:00.019 --> 01:43:01.640
I don't understand this war.

829
01:43:03.598 --> 01:43:05.634
My corps was the cavalry.

830
01:43:07.252 --> 01:43:09.786
You should've made a career of it,
like I said.

831
01:43:11.033 --> 01:43:15.185
Today, I'm asked to fight a war
where the shovel outweighs the rifle.

832
01:43:16.552 --> 01:43:19.292
In which people swap addresses
with the enemy,

833
01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:21.163
to meet when it's all over...

834
01:43:23.818 --> 01:43:29.300
Plus the cat we found with a note
from the Germans: Good luck, comrades!

835
01:43:29.301 --> 01:43:33.907
I was ordered to arrest the cat
for high treason...

836
01:43:36.359 --> 01:43:37.605
Until further notice.

837
01:43:39.637 --> 01:43:41.134
You're a grandfather, Dad.

838
01:43:56.506 --> 01:43:57.956
His name is Henri.

839
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:01.481
What are you on about?

840
01:44:04.716 --> 01:44:06.249
How do you know that?

841
01:44:07.287 --> 01:44:10.025
You wouldn't understand.

842
01:44:12.473 --> 01:44:13.591
Henri?

843
01:44:17.075 --> 01:44:18.279
Not bad.

844
01:44:20.435 --> 01:44:21.927
Henri Audebert!

845
01:44:26.239 --> 01:44:28.644
Let's try and survive this war for him.

846
01:44:36.443 --> 01:44:37.603
Chin up.

847
01:45:04.022 --> 01:45:05.347
Be seated!

848
01:45:10.324 --> 01:45:14.677
In two days' time
you will be in East-Prussia

849
01:45:14.678 --> 01:45:18.783
to take part in an offensive
against the Russian army.

850
01:45:18.784 --> 01:45:23.470
I hope you'll show pugnacity
in the face of the enemy.

851
01:45:23.471 --> 01:45:27.077
This train will cross the fatherland,

852
01:45:27.078 --> 01:45:30.394
but it won't be possible
for you to see your families.

853
01:45:30.395 --> 01:45:32.221
Why?

854
01:45:32.861 --> 01:45:34.391
I think you can guess.

855
01:45:37.457 --> 01:45:39.069
Long live Kaiser Wilhelm!

856
01:45:39.111 --> 01:45:40.559
Long live the Kaiser!

857
01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:02.657
They hand it out to just anybody!

858
01:48:04.590 --> 01:48:06.950
This film is dedicated to the soldiers

859
01:48:06.992 --> 01:48:11.007
who fraternized on Christmas 1914
in several places on the front.
