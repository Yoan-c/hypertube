1
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.277
Hang in there, Sergeant.

2
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.919
American heroism has a new face today.

3
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.037
Despite heavy enemy fire,

4
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.909
a young infantryman rushes to the aid
of his fallen sergeant.

5
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.435
This now-famous image
was captured on a camera

6
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.637
abandoned by an embedded reporter

7
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.159
during an ambush by anti-coalition forces
in Al-Ansakar, Diyala Province, Iraq.

8
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.673
Nineteen-year-old Specialist William Lynn
was awarded the Silver Star,

9
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.917
and he and the eight-man Bravo squad

10
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.754
have spent the last two weeks
touring the country,

11
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.832
receiving the nation's thanks.

12
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.630
Their tour ends right here in Dallas,
where they'll be performing

13
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.992
in Thursday's halftime show
alongside Destiny's Child.

14
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.435
Hello?

15
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.517
Hey, Billy. How's your head, buddy?

16
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.518
- What?
- You get a good night's sleep?

17
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.479
Yeah, those strippers last night
were really into you, man.

18
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.199
What are you talking about?

19
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.839
Hey, remember that halftime show
we're doing?

20
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.320
- Shit!
- With Destiny's Child?

21
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.720
Why don't you join us, dumbass?

22
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.996
Here's the reason why people love this story.

23
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.919
They give us hope,
they give us reason not to despair.

24
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.630
Yeah.

25
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.757
Six minutes and 40 seconds late.

26
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.910
Yes.

27
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.238
- Are you flakin' on me, Lynn?
- No, Sergeant.

28
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.152
Just dreaming about cheerleaders.

29
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.113
- Good man.
- I know it's not a popular war,

30
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.271
and I know what's going on
in the media right now,

31
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.875
but Bravo's a story about America
feeling good about America again.

32
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.640
When the last time you felt good
about that, huh? Tell me.

33
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.959
Dude! She really liked me.
She gave me a freebie.

34
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.039
Sykes, you are so full of shit, man.
We were all wasted last night.

35
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.635
I can't remember shit.
You sure as hell can't remember shit.

36
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.558
Well, all I know is I got a free dance.

37
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.798
We all got a free dance, boy.
Strippers love their country, too.

38
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.075
What I'm saying is,

39
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.277
there was a connection between us,
you know?

40
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.476
Emotion and shit.

41
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.110
That's her job, motherfucker.
Supposed to make you feel like they like you.

42
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.078
Waitress, actress, stripper, prostitute.

43
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.640
Go fuck yourself.

44
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.359
Come on. At ease with the trash talk, fellas.

45
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.080
- We're in front of civilians.
- Yeah. Hey, listen up, all of you.

46
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.271
Right now,
by the grace of God and the media,

47
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.352
we are the face of the American military,

48
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.796
and you will act accordingly.
Do I make myself clear?

49
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.030
Hooah!

50
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.794
Man, we're gonna look ridiculous.

51
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.837
Tell me about it, man. This whole tour's been

52
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.713
one big dog-and-pony show
for the cameras, Sergeant.

53
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.314
Those were just local appearances.

54
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.040
At halftime, we will be performing
on national television

55
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.952
in front of 40 million viewers.

56
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.794
Now, if that happens to be
the mother of all clusterfucks,

57
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.678
then we should blame it on bad intelligence.

58
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.750
Inspiring words, Sergeant.

59
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.638
No, they're not the...
No, they're not the elite force.

60
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.955
No, they're a bunch of kids thrown into
the deep end of a not-so-popular war.

61
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.110
And what do they do?

62
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.476
They bond together with love
and brotherhood, that's what they do.

63
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.597
You can't write that shit, man. Come on!

64
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.880
You guys the Bravos?

65
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.510
What gave us away?

66
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.639
Sergeant David Dime.

67
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.794
These are the men of 2nd Squad,
otherwise known to the media as "Bravo."

68
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.156
Well, I'm Josh. I'm liaison from the team,

69
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.197
so if you guys need anything today,
you just tell me.

70
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.953
- I'll be taking care of you, all right?
- Hooah.

71
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.679
Sykes would like his dignity back.

72
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.513
- Crack needs to go fuck himself.
- Come on.

73
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.069
This is Albert Brown,
producer extraordinaire.

74
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.999
- How are you?
- Army set us up with him.

75
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.992
You ever seen the "Fight Night" movies?

76
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.312
- No.
- Well, you're missing out.

77
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.552
He'll be rolling with us today.

78
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.110
Is everybody here?

79
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.476
- Present and accounted for.
- Wait, where's Major Mac?

80
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.994
We're missing our public affairs coordinator.

81
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.150
He's here, Sergeant.

82
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.836
Major McLaurin, I'm Josh.
I'm gonna be taking care of you...

83
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.910
He can't hear you.

84
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.515
Major McLaurin was blown up
on the first day of his tour

85
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.910
by an improvised explosive device.

86
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.112
Twice. Lost his hearing.

87
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.238
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

88
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.035
Well, here's your ride to the stadium.

89
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.589
Courtesy of Mr. Oglesby.
So if you guys'll just...

90
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.680
Wait, wait. Norm Oglesby sent this?

91
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.792
Who the fuck is Norm Oglesby?

92
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.351
All right, now,
that's what I'm talkin' about.

93
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.079
- Just one little drink, Sergeant.
- No!

94
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.196
But, Sergeant...

95
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.159
Sykes, have you not had
your morning glass of shut-up?

96
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.871
"Quietness, quietness over this countryside,

97
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.194
"except for unmistakable signals on radio...

98
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.591
"Has anyone looked in the eyes of the dead?

99
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.431
"Is anyone living
to look for future forgiveness?"

100
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.314
Well, I'm not much for poetry,
but this was one of Sergeant Breem...

101
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.959
Shroom's favorites.

102
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.070
I remember him
walking around base camp perimeter

103
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.277
reciting this kind of stuff really loud.

104
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.191
"Just sharing the wisdom," he said,

105
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.476
when I'd tell him to shut the hell up.

106
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.876
Maybe Shroom had a point.

107
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.390
But personally, I believe
he was really using his voice

108
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.120
to let the insurgents draw a bead on us
with their mortars,

109
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.476
because that's the kind
of person Shroom was,

110
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.552
always thinking of the other guy.

111
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.559
Private Beckwith!

112
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.116
Here, Sergeant!

113
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.395
Sergeant Holliday!

114
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.835
Here, Sergeant!

115
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.235
Specialist Koch!

116
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.960
Here, Sergeant!

117
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.760
Specialist Yang!

118
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.035
Here, Sergeant!

119
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.349
Specialist Lynn!

120
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.636
Here, Sergeant!

121
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.750
Private Sykes!

122
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.950
Here, Sergeant!

123
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.639
Specialist Montoya!

124
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.115
Here, Sergeant!

125
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.032
Staff Sergeant Breem!

126
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.712
Staff Sergeant Virgil Breem!

127
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.633
Staff Sergeant Virgil Jeremiah Breem!

128
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.117
Honor Guard! Attention!

129
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.351
Ready! Aim!

130
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.030
Fire!

131
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.231
Ready! Aim! Fire!

132
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.631
Aunt Marie said she hardly recognized you
on TV, you'd gotten so big.

133
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.632
What's the Army been feedin' you?

134
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.473
We order Domino's, mostly.

135
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.676
It's easier than cooking.

136
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.355
They don't really have those
over there, do they?

137
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.717
Yeah. And free extra cheese
with every medal, right, Billy?

138
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.315
Kathryn!

139
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.517
Everyone in town's been asking about you.

140
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.673
It's like we're celebrities.

141
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.437
The neighbors all say how proud they are
of you and how grateful they are.

142
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.957
Billy, you're not on duty, you're home,
so go put your dogs up.

143
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.269
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.352
Come help me get the casserole dish down.

145
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.239
I'm makin' your favorite, chicken tetrazzini.

146
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.232
Except I'm making it with turkey
instead of chicken

147
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.834
since you can't be here for Thanksgiving.

148
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.879
- I figure turkey's just as good, right?
- Turkey's just as good, Mom.

149
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.840
And I have stocked the fridge
full of Cokes, Dr Pepper,

150
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.116
sweet tea, all your favorites.

151
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.870
Or we could slip out the back
and have a beer.

152
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.155
Kathryn.

153
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.519
Kathryn! Get in here and let your brother be!

154
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.199
Change, though.

155
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.040
You wear that to dinner,
and I'm gonna wear my prom dress.

156
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.713
It's tempting.

157
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.152
Hey, you, little man. What's up?

158
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.035
You getting big and strong like your dad?

159
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.475
Where's Pete?

160
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.439
He's working a double shift.
He sends his regards.

161
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.039
Billy.

162
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.237
We've been praying for you, you know that?

163
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.437
We're all so proud of you.

164
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.719
...saw an opportunity and came here...

165
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.031
- Him, too.
- ...overrunning the town and setting up

166
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.117
- headquarters at the police station.
- In his way.

167
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.989
Before dawn on Saturday,
Captain Brown's men,

168
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.589
together with Iraqi forces,
some wearing masks,

169
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.360
led an assault on the police station.

170
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.436
Dad.

171
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.070
After searching 24 hours,
the troops found nothing but a few guns.

172
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.357
Locals say the insurgents
had already moved on.

173
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.034
No drink on game day?

174
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.591
No. No, Dan, I'm excited, too.
Yes, I'm excited. Yes.

175
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.474
Talk to your client. I'll do my thing.
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

176
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.880
Hey, guys. Good news. Hey.

177
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.440
- We got interest...
- Hey, listen up.

178
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.477
Hey, we got interest from a major star.

179
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.954
Matt Damon?

180
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.315
- No.
- DiCaprio.

181
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.720
- No.
- Matt Damon?

182
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.154
I just said, "Matt Damon".

183
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.518
Hey. Hey, this may not be a name

184
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.075
that comes readily to mind
to you guys, but hear me out.

185
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.355
- Hear me out.
- All right.

186
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.590
Hilary Swank.

187
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.080
- Whoa.
- What?

188
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.590
She won an Oscar playing a guy
in Boys Don't Cry.

189
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.433
Well, she played a girl
pretending to be a guy.

190
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.638
We know who she is. Who she is.
Why is she interested in us?

191
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.359
Because she wants to play him.

192
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.273
Oh, man!

193
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.797
I know this may not be the ideal choice,

194
00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.633
but let me tell you something,
if she gets attached,

195
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.992
other stars hear about it
and they start sniffing around,

196
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.072
and next thing you know, Mark Wahlberg.

197
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.117
- Dirk Diggler. Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.

198
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.920
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is she playing him as a girl,

199
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.514
or as a girl playing a guy?

200
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.318
If Hilary Swank gets on board,
this movie gets made.

201
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.160
- Which means you guys get paid.
- Yeah, how much?

202
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.636
Well, if we get a major star
and I'm just guessing,

203
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.394
so don't hold me to it,
maybe 100 grand each.

204
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.711
Fuck you. We could make that much?

205
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.231
Means I got a lot of work getting it made,
and then everybody get paid,

206
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.238
but a lot of things got to happen.

207
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.079
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Boys!

208
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.719
Hundred grand's a lot of money.

209
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.672
Sensible ideas on how to spend it?

210
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.877
I don't know. Probably help pay down
my sister's medical bills.

211
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.189
Oh, yeah. Word up, yo.

212
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.192
That's true. Family comes first, man.

213
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.715
Like I told my moms,
I'm gonna buy her a new car.

214
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.598
- Fuck family.
- Yeah.

215
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.195
I'm getting myself
a top-of-the-line Sauer 202,

216
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.919
couple of vintage fly rods,

217
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.311
spend the next three years up in Montana
just huntin' and fishin'.

218
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.159
Hey, what the fuck, Sykes!

219
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.636
- Get him down now.
- Sit down, boy! Park that...

220
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.551
Hey, hey, hey, everything okay back there?

221
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.869
- It's all good, man.
- Yeah.

222
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.838
- Yeah, we're good.
- Hey, Josh. Nice hair.

223
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.071
Yeah, man, you're looking
all spiffy and crewed up.

224
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.355
Who's your stylist, Papi?

225
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.716
Hey, Josh, what can you tell us
about the halftime, bro?

226
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.917
Yeah, when can I get
my lap dance from Beyoncé?

227
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.434
- Sykes, shut!
- Hey, Josh,

228
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.160
- do you know Norm, like, personally?
- You're full of shit, yo.

229
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.357
For God's sake. I'm just trying to find out,

230
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.312
Josh, what's expected of us, bro.

231
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.073
Okay, well, there's no details yet,

232
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.710
but knowing Mr. Oglesby,
it's sure to be a real extravaganza.

233
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.913
Does this Hummer come with Advil?

234
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.753
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry. But...

235
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.196
But I'll be sure you get some
when we arrive, okay?

236
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.954
A musical? Are you shittin' me? Larry...

237
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.992
Billy, what if you don't go back?

238
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.600
There are a ton of ways
you could get shipped home.

239
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.558
Or at least out of active duty.

240
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.390
I mean, you're a decorated hero, Billy.
You've done your part.

241
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.477
...about more than just blowing shit up.

242
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.916
Larry, Larry, my boys ship out in two days,

243
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.356
and access becomes
extremely problematic after that,

244
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.000
unless your lawyers
want to parachute into a war zone.

245
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.790
Well, come on, let's get this shit done.

246
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.559
Sarge, you want to stop here?

247
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.556
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

248
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.910
Good.

249
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.998
Let me guess. Just fell off a truck?

250
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.757
Says a boy brought it,
but doesn't know from where.

251
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.390
Mister! Mister!

252
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.712
Hello, my friend. You want big movie?

253
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.075
Which one you got here?

254
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.759
You want big movie? Mister!

255
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.876
Mister! Hello!

256
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.679
Hey, Crack, they got Finding Nemo.

257
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.274
- I love this shit.
- Finding Nemo.

258
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.874
- How much?
- Sykes!

259
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.392
Aren't you a little old for that, soldier?

260
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.716
No, Sarge, it's for... It's for my daughter.

261
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.117
Life during wartime.

262
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.913
Okay, guys, these are your seats right here.

263
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.357
Got you the best row in the house.
This is Mr. Oglesby's reserved section.

264
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.676
Make yourself at home.
You need anything, you let me know.

265
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.479
I think... I think she likes you.

266
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.711
- Don't you fucking lie to me.
- Hey. Stand down now,

267
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.679
or I'll have both of you
running laps around the stadium.

268
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.437
- Excuse me.
- Look at all these people.

269
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.434
What do you think they're thinking about?

270
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.273
Heavy stuff.

271
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.394
God. Philosophy.

272
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.633
The meaning of life.

273
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.593
There it is.

274
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.118
You look good.

275
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.112
You are a shit liar.

276
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.034
Thank you.

277
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.314
Hey, the doctor said, and I'm quoting here,

278
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.437
my face is 87% healed.

279
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.153
And check it out.

280
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.076
It's two more operations,
and that is goodbye, Miss Frankenstein.

281
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.233
How about you?

282
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.160
You gettin' any?

283
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.994
None of your business.

284
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.597
Yeah, well, that's a big fat no.

285
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.990
So you've killed for your country
and you're still a virgin.

286
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.640
- If that's not a sign of how fucked...
- So, how are things here?

287
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.234
Don't change the subject.

288
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.876
You better be out there gettin' some, boy.

289
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.599
Are you?

290
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.475
Guess.

291
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.115
Some nights I'm like,

292
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.597
whatever, maybe I'll just go
cruise the high school boys

293
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.115
and be like,
"Hey, bubba, take a ride with me.

294
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.680
"Once you've had a girl
with a scar on her face..."

295
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.399
So, how are things here?

296
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.479
I worry about you.

297
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.159
I can't stop worrying about you.
I feel so responsible.

298
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.030
I'm all right.

299
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.999
Your bad.
Thanks for getting me in this shit, Kat.

300
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.597
You know what I mean.

301
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.200
Billy, what the fuck are you doing?

302
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.873
Let's see what this bad boy can do.

303
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.475
I'm not getting an Article 15 because of you.

304
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.835
If they let us Texans all drive,

305
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.480
there'd be no need
for PT belts and safety briefs.

306
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.438
Just 'cause you were conceived in a truck

307
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.477
- doesn't mean you got to die in one.
- Watch this.

308
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.597
- Oh, shit.
- It could save your life someday.

309
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.435
Fuck! Stop!

310
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.793
Oh, shit!

311
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.550
Private Lynn, you are one delinquent punk!

312
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.073
No excuse, Sergeant.

313
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.392
That is correct, Private Lynn.
There is no excuse for your existence.

314
00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.678
You got a long, glorious history
of being a shit-bag, don't you?

315
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.038
We heard all about your
criminal butt-fuckery in Texas.

316
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.310
But, Billy, you're no longer in Texas.

317
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.754
So speak up!

318
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.079
Sergeant Breem, Sergeant Dime,

319
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.073
I'm just bustin' my ass tryin'
to be a credit to my platoon.

320
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.592
What in the world led you to believe
you could join the infantry?

321
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.876
You know, the Army needs flute players, too.

322
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.232
I want to defend my homeland, Sergeant.

323
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.879
Bullshit. Keep running.

324
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.194
Hunt down terrorists.

325
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.476
Well, let us know when you find them.

326
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.479
Bring democracy to Iraq.

327
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.234
Lynn, your stupidity
is robbing this world of oxygen,

328
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.720
and I won't stand for it!

329
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.800
Get to the pull-up bars.

330
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.631
Private, did I say recover?

331
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.192
I did it for my sister.

332
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.472
Okay, drop.

333
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.474
Your sister?

334
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.479
Continue, Private Lynn.

335
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.758
My sister Kathryn,

336
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.833
sophomore year at college,
was driving home from work.

337
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.800
Heavy rain.

338
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.919
Big Mercedes goes into a spin,
broadsides her.

339
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.390
Car's totaled.

340
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.756
Fractured leg, pelvis.

341
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.632
A hundred and seventy stitches
below the neck, 63 above.

342
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.791
- Kat was this angel.
- You're creeping me out, Lynn.

343
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.156
I know how you Texas boys are
about your sisters.

344
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.754
Stay on point, Private.

345
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.551
My sister came this close to death.

346
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.117
And then her pussy-boy fiancé dumps her?

347
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.239
In the hospital?

348
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.314
And what did you do?

349
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.312
I sort of went and fucked up his car.

350
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.120
Seems like Private Lynn
has an issue with vehicles.

351
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.474
What kind of car?

352
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.919
Brand-new Saab convertible
with graphite alloy rims.

353
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.317
And I chased after him with a tire iron.

354
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.838
Just... I just wanted to see him run.

355
00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.994
My dad...

356
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.470
My dad was able to get him
to drop the charges

357
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.029
if I went to the recruiter's
office the next day.

358
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.272
No regrets, Sergeant.

359
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.191
Hey, y'all. Look! It's you!

360
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.040
Ladies and gentlemen,

361
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.399
America's sport proudly honors
America's heroes.

362
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.475
- Welcome, heroes of Al-Ansakar Canal.
- Beyoncé!

363
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.960
Put a lid on it, Sykes.

364
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.391
Staff Sergeant David Dime,

365
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.756
Sergeant Antonio Holliday,

366
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.951
Specialist William Lynn,

367
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.960
Specialist Marcellino Montoya,

368
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.720
Specialist Theodore Yang,

369
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.920
Specialist Robert Earl Koch,

370
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.630
Private Lodis Beckwith

371
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.831
and Private Kenneth Sykes.

372
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.273
USA!

373
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.877
If you suffer from erectile dysfunction,

374
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.758
it could be due to inadequate blood flow...

375
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.354
Figures.

376
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.070
Sergeant, request permission
to switch seats.

377
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.429
Permission denied, Specialist Lynn.

378
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.910
You will take it for the team.
Move out and draw fire.

379
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.599
Roger that.

380
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.509
Hi. I saw you on the TV.

381
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.311
It was just like a movie.
I was just so proud.

382
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.437
You guys are the best.
I'm right there with you.

383
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.432
No. Not with you in Iraq, but...

384
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.989
My cousin's girlfriend's brother
is also serving in Iraq.

385
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.400
You remind of my dear late husband, Fred.

386
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.675
I wear a uniform, too, but...

387
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.240
I must have watched your video, like...

388
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.436
Then we could drop a big one on Fallujah.

389
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.590
But you boys, you're the real thing.

390
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.672
- ...your supreme sacrifice.
- ...keep you in my heart.

391
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.479
Just like it says in the 89th Psalm.

392
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.029
...gettin' 72 virgins in Heaven. Why 72?

393
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.430
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.749
- Good job.
- Good job.

395
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.876
Very cool.

396
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.269
Josh, man, I'm starving right now.

397
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.953
Can we please stop and get a slice of pizza,

398
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.918
- a hot dog, something?
- I'm sorry, man, we just...

399
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.356
We have to head to the end zone
now for the video shoot.

400
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.636
- What video shoot?
- They didn't tell you guys?

401
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.996
You're gonna be starring
in the official team greeting.

402
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.673
- Go America!
- Wait, what about...

403
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.194
What about halftime, Josh?

404
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.272
I am still waiting on intel from HQ.

405
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.393
"Intel"? "HQ"?
That's, like, G.I. Joe talk, Josh.

406
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.473
Hey, but seriously, Josh,
you're gonna look out for us, right?

407
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.756
We don't want to look like
a bunch of morons on TV. Understand?

408
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.069
- Of course.
- You are a soldier, Mango.

409
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.276
Just be prepared.

410
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.317
Yeah, but prepared for what,
is what I'm trying to find out.

411
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.234
For whatever. Have you not learned this yet
from being in Iraq?

412
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.677
You see, in Iraq, people just try to kill you,
not make you look like a douche bag.

413
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.638
Oh, shit. Don't worry about that, bro.

414
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.638
You'll always be a douche bag in my book.

415
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.592
Okay, okay, guys, it's gonna be fine.

416
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.275
But sorry, one second.
Where's Major McLaurin?

417
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.715
Shit.

418
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.510
Lodis, Sykes, go find Major Mac.
Bring him to the end zone.

419
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.750
- Yes, Sarge.
- Josh?

420
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.480
- Advil?
- Oh, shit, shit. Sorry.

421
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.592
I'm sorry. Sorry. Yes, yes.

422
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.911
I will definitely get that
for you right away.

423
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.919
Okay. Okay, so you guys
can just wait right here,

424
00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.157
and I will go tell them that we're ready.

425
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.511
- Wait, there's Major Mac.
- Wonders never cease.

426
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.596
So, so let's get this straight.
You say you want the shooting,

427
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.639
you want stuff blowing up,
but no swearing and no smoking?

428
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.152
That guy ever come up for air?

429
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.475
It's cool, man.

430
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.518
- Man's closing our deal.
- Better be.

431
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.190
My mom's gonna be pissed
if I don't get her that car, man.

432
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.317
Hey, Billy. Go long.

433
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.079
You got it!

434
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.791
Specialist Lynn comes through in the clutch!

435
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.596
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Steven.
That's Steven. I gotta call you back.

436
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.154
It's Steven. He's calling. Okay, bye.

437
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.991
- Hey! Let's go! Let's go!
- Ready, aim, fire!

438
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.957
- Play football, Albert?
- I play a little bit.

439
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.919
- Get off me!
- Get the hell off my field!

440
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.836
Get off now! Get off!

441
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.435
- Mango, Mango, Mango!
- Hey, you! Get off!

442
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.432
I think we need to get off the field.

443
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.193
- Go! Go!
- Let 'em play!

444
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.836
- Get off! Get off!
- Dude!

445
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.670
Off! Let go of that ball! Get off the field!
Get off...

446
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.831
- Put him down!
- I'm taking this Viet Cong off your...

447
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.110
You boys better watch out.

448
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.317
That gentleman's pretty touchy
about his field.

449
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.359
Hey, game's over, boys. Come on, rally up.

450
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.794
Let's go, guys, let's go.

451
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.515
Hey, the man don't care
about our sacrifices, sir.

452
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.910
Keeping his ass safe from WMDs and stuff.

453
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.790
Well, to be fair, he does do a good job
keeping up the grounds.

454
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.115
Hey, Mango.

455
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.511
Doesn't all that green make you
just want to crank up that lawnmower

456
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.717
- and have a go at it?
- It's AstroTurf, you moron.

457
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.359
At ease, at ease, at ease.

458
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.433
My apologies, sir.
That's just how we talk amongst ourselves.

459
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.557
I can appreciate good trash talk.

460
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.355
It's not the best I've heard,
but still pretty good.

461
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.318
- Why, thank you, sir.
- All I'm saying is,

462
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.800
any beaner would love a...

463
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.155
- Hey, show some respect.
- Lock it up. Mango, come on.

464
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.435
Eyes front, y'all.

465
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.910
High-value target, 11 o'clock,
20 meters. Goddamn!

466
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.990
Excuse me.

467
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.912
- I see Mrs. Mango right there.
- Doesn't miss a thing, does he?

468
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.231
- Come on.
- Hey.

469
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.359
- On the whistle.
- Let's go.

470
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.639
Bad news?

471
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.755
No, sir. Are you...

472
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.470
That's right. And you must be
Specialist William Lynn, right?

473
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.278
Specialist Lynn,
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

474
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.591
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.
- The honor's mine.

475
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.637
You're part of a famous tradition now.

476
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.638
Audie Murphy? You heard of him?

477
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.836
Heroes of the Alamo.
I know you heard of them.

478
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.435
Everybody knows Texans
make the best fighters.

479
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.398
I never thought of it that way, sir.

480
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.437
And modest, too. I like that.

481
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.155
- You're from Stovall, correct?
- Yes, sir, I am.

482
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.074
I know it. Grew up near Sweetwater myself.

483
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.920
Started my first real estate company
in the area.

484
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.789
Excuse me, Mr. Oglesby.
Everything's ready for the videotaping, sir.

485
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.634
Okay, now hold your balls up like this.

486
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.110
- Big smiles, girls!
- Everyone ready?

487
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.520
And action.

488
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.391
Bravo Squad would like to wish
you and your families

489
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.800
a very happy Thanksgiving.

490
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.351
And to our brother and sister
soldiers in the field,

491
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.630
Hajji don't surf!

492
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.674
Cut! That was not in the...

493
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.753
Bravo Squad would like
to wish you and your family...

494
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.155
Cut! People, we...

495
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.637
Bravo Squad would like
to wish you and your family

496
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.877
a very happy Thanksgiving.

497
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.395
Go team!

498
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.073
Dallas sucks horse cock!

499
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.833
- Boo!
- You suck!

500
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.038
American soldiers strong and true,

501
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.552
the best in the world at what they do.

502
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.032
Thanks for keeping us safe and strong...

503
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.110
Come on, Bravo.

504
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.351
...against all those who would do us harm.

505
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.159
Bravo, USA! Bravo, USA!

506
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.874
USA!

507
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.630
Now, if you want to talk about a group
that knows how to suit up and show up,

508
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.949
well, here they are.

509
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.312
The best our nation has to offer.

510
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.355
I have to say, I have never...

511
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.118
I have never been prouder to be an American

512
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.556
than when I saw that footage
of Bravo in action.

513
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.799
Now, it's my personal feeling
that the War on Terror

514
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.593
may be just about as pure a fight

515
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.320
between good and evil
as we're likely to ever see.

516
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.236
And would the world be a better place
with Saddam Hussein in power?

517
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.919
I bet a grateful Mr. and Mrs.
Mohammed Q Public in Baghdad

518
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.556
would have a thing or two
to tell the naysayers about that.

519
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.750
Now, I was visiting
with the President recently,

520
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.232
and he assured me we are winning this war,
make no mistake.

521
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.197
As long as we keep our eye on the ball,
we shall prevail.

522
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.236
- Sir.
- Welcome to Texas.

523
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.679
So, what are your feelings
as you look forward to the halftime show?

524
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.911
We weren't issued feelings, sir.

525
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.199
My men are ready for anything.

526
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.237
Just don't ask us to dance,
and we'll be all right.

527
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.195
Ma'am.

528
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.791
Any trouble sleeping or readjusting
to life back home?

529
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.835
No, ma'am.

530
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.195
I sleep fine.

531
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.634
Yeah, I'm good.

532
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.949
Sir in the back.

533
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.913
What was your hardest mission?

534
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.918
When we lost Sergeant Breem.

535
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.556
Are we making a difference over there?

536
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.679
Absolutely, sir. America's out there

537
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.912
producing dozens of suicidally
pissed-off insurgents every day.

538
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.276
Are we making a difference over there?

539
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.399
I think we are, yes.

540
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.798
We are making a difference, definitely.

541
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.479
What do you do during your downtime?
For fun.

542
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.149
Masturbate.

543
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.710
- Masturbate.
- Masturbate, just all over the place.

544
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.634
What do you do during your downtime?
For fun.

545
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.795
Most days we're putting in 12 to 14 hours.

546
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.351
When we get a little
kick-back time, though...

547
00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.669
Guys?

548
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.392
I like to lift weights.

549
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.359
I play video games.

550
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.520
I have a plethora of board games.

551
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.831
Yeah, my... My baby girl sent us her copy
of Chutes and Ladders.

552
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.600
Keeps us battle-ready.

553
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.592
"I like to kill my enemies and listen
to the lamentation of their women."

554
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.035
That's from Conan the Barbarian.
I just always wanted to say that.

555
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.040
Sir in the back.

556
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.952
So, what inspired Bravo to do
what it did that fateful day at AI-Ansakar?

557
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.158
Specialist Lynn was the first to recognize
what was going on down there.

558
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.197
He was also the first one to react.

559
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.792
I think he's the appropriate one
to answer your question.

560
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.032
To tell you the honest truth, sir,
I don't remember all that much.

561
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.598
I saw Shroom, Sergeant Breem,
being dragged away,

562
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.911
so I wanted to get him back.

563
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.633
And I guess my training just kicked in.

564
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.632
According to your Silver Star citation,

565
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.916
you were in hand-to-hand combat
with one of the insurgents.

566
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.229
Is that right?

567
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.479
I mostly returned fire
and rendered aid to Sergeant Breem.

568
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.756
Yeah, but you also got
to engage the enemy up close.

569
00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.958
I mean, not many soldiers
are given that kind of experience.

570
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.118
"Given"? I mean,
it's not what I wanted to do.

571
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.357
The... The guy just jumped me, and we...

572
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.474
- What was it like?
- What was what like, sir?

573
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.235
Well, to be so close to the enemy.

574
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.554
It wasn't like we had that much time
to get acquainted.

575
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.356
Look, it all happened
real fast, okay? I just...

576
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.039
It's not something I'm real proud of, but...

577
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.911
You know, I did what I had to do.

578
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.512
USA!

579
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.275
Yeah, the Hindus were onto something, Billy.

580
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.276
Ours is what they called
"the karma of action."

581
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.359
The way of the warrior.

582
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.712
Sorry fucking excuse for a warrior
I'm turning out to be.

583
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.715
Only if you keep asking why.

584
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.113
Like, "Why must I always
take point on patrol?"

585
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.477
Or, "Why must I kill?"

586
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.149
Always wanting answers?
That's just desire, bro.

587
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.679
And that shit'll trap you inside of yourself.

588
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.434
And believe me, you don't want to be there,
especially when you're out here.

589
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.319
Yeah. Well, what if I desire
not to get killed?

590
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.837
Well, it's useless to worry about it.

591
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.190
If a bullet's gonna get you,
it's already been fired.

592
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.073
Don't worry.

593
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.638
Any suggestions?

594
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.439
"Always perform with detachment
any action you must do.

595
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.830
"And surrender all actions to me."

596
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.039
This is what Krishna tells the warrior Arjuna

597
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.994
when he's hesitating the night
before the great battle.

598
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.192
Krishna. That's the dude
with the blue skin, right?

599
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.477
An avatar of Vishnu, the supreme deity.

600
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.837
Not in my part of Texas.

601
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.719
Look, Billy,

602
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.200
it doesn't have to be about God or country.

603
00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.516
Just find something bigger than yourself.

604
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.040
Some actually prefer to believe
they're already dead.

605
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.795
Bob, I'm glad you asked me that question,

606
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.874
because it gives me the opportunity
to clear up a few misconceptions.

607
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.640
Shit.

608
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.230
You okay?

609
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.080
Yeah.

610
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.033
I'm just a little beat.

611
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.157
Sounds like it's been a long tour.

612
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.432
- Iraq or America?
- I guess both.

613
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.759
I'm Faison.

614
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.958
- Say again?
- Faison.

615
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.356
F-A-I-S-O-N.

616
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.674
And I know who you are,
Billy Lynn from Stovall.

617
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.880
My great-grandmother
was Miss Stovall, 1937.

618
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.189
How 'bout that?

619
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.954
Everyone said she had a shot
at winning Miss Texas that year.

620
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.992
Really? And how'd she do?

621
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.190
Second runner-up.

622
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.476
Everybody said she should've won,
but the fix was in.

623
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.358
You know how those pageant deals work.

624
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.159
Yeah, I do.

625
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.794
Actually, no, I don't.

626
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.671
I have no idea how
those pageant deals work.

627
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.236
I don't know much about anything, really.

628
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.839
Could have fooled me.

629
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.197
I've gotten kind of used to telling people
stuff they want to hear.

630
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.637
No. You put it right out there.

631
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.309
And that's strong. I mean...

632
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.470
Grappling with the enemy up close like that.

633
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.559
Your friend's death.
You were right there with him.

634
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.472
Can't be easy talking to a roomful
of strangers about those things.

635
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.995
It is sort of weird being honored
for the worst day of your life.

636
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.033
It's like...

637
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.715
Never mind.

638
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.152
So, what's it like being a cheerleader?

639
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.079
You really want to know?

640
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.953
Yeah. I really do.

641
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.870
Really.

642
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.278
Well, it's great.

643
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.592
I mean, people see us on TV,

644
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.390
and they think that's all there is to it.

645
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.076
You know, dancing and having fun,

646
00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.276
but community service
is actually the main part of our job.

647
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.030
Visiting hospitals,
working with underprivileged kids,

648
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.192
stuff like that, you know?

649
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.677
To me, that's been the most satisfying thing
about being a cheerleader,

650
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.352
serving others. The spiritual aspect of it.

651
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.310
Billy,

652
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.279
are you a Christian?

653
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.157
I'm searching.

654
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.034
Do you pray?

655
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.711
Not as much as I should.

656
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.517
I never got much from going to church,

657
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.240
but then in Iraq,
in the middle of all this shooting,

658
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.235
my friend Shroom, Sergeant Breem, gets hit.

659
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.434
He's just, you know,

660
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.995
lying there, bleeding out.

661
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.395
And when I go to him, suddenly,
for the first time in my life,

662
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.473
I feel close to something...

663
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.352
I don't know, bigger than myself.

664
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.993
And when Shroom died,
I felt something passing through me,

665
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.714
like...

666
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.069
Like his soul or...

667
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.034
I don't know.

668
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.076
Billy.

669
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.236
Most of the time, that's how it works.

670
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.958
Life gets so dark,
and we think all the light's gone out of us,

671
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.673
but it's always there.

672
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.558
If we just open the door a crack,
the light comes pouring in.

673
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.755
You know how we kept looking at each...

674
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.790
I think God wanted us to meet today.

675
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.554
We are all called to be his lights
out in the world.

676
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.599
And I truly believe that we...

677
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.111
Look, if you couldn't deliver,
why'd you tell the guys that number?

678
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.556
Now they think they're coming home
to Jacuzzis and shit.

679
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.199
I told them a lot of things have to happen.

680
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.516
It's Thanksgiving in LA.
I just need more time to deliver.

681
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.319
- Yeah, we don't have time, Albert.
- I... I know.

682
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.711
- Jesus, what happened to you?
- Nothing.

683
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.951
Why do you look like you just got laid?

684
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.554
Gather round, boys.
Here's a little gift for you from the team.

685
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.630
Answers.

686
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.791
- Thank you.
- Now, these are actual game balls.

687
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.352
But they'll look better with a little
ink on 'em, don't you think?

688
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.632
Hooah. Thank you.

689
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.433
There you go.

690
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.760
Thank you, sir.

691
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.478
- Thanks.
- No problem.

692
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.869
Hey, listen.

693
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.317
What you carry out there?

694
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.719
Most of the time my weapon's the M4,
standard semi-automatic assault rifle.

695
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.754
A few times I've been on the.50,
what we carry on top of our Humvees.

696
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.669
That's a heavy machine gun,
lays down 550 rounds a minute.

697
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.240
Incendiary rounds
that could punch through an inch of steel.

698
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.789
The M4.

699
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.319
I mean, what does it do
when it... When it hits somebody?

700
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.396
- Fucks 'em up.
- But does it kill them?

701
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.629
I mean, stopping power's what I'm getting at.

702
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.796
Maybe not with a body shot.
That's why we aim for the face.

703
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.078
The.50, I read about that sucker
in Guns & Ammo.

704
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.199
Been in every single war since the 1920s.
What's that one like?

705
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.517
Well, you hit someone with a.50,
it takes 'em apart like...

706
00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.960
Like a pink mist.

707
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.634
You ever kill somebody?

708
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.996
I mean, like...

709
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.279
Watch 'em die?

710
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.870
Yes.

711
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.758
What's that feel like?

712
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.552
It doesn't feel like anything.
Not while it's happening.

713
00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.552
Come on, man.

714
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.552
- You can tell us.
- Come on.

715
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.351
What's it feel like when you hit somebody?
Like, really connect.

716
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.519
Look at the crap they use
to protect themselves.

717
00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.671
- Do you guys have half this shit?
- Nope.

718
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.434
Grab an equipment bag
and you can take some back.

719
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.510
Do it.

720
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.353
Hey, Billy, find where
they're keeping the steroids?

721
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.275
Roy.

722
00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.956
You remember my wife, Nikki. Tiffany.
Excuse me.

723
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.392
Hello. Thrilled you could come.

724
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.069
Come on in.

725
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.629
Thank you.

726
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.398
Now, normally, I like to give
thanks to God before kickoff

727
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.711
for the blessings we've received...

728
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.839
And the games we've won.

729
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.478
But this Thanksgiving,
I want to honor my special guests.

730
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.990
A group of soldiers called Bravo.

731
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.760
Their presence here serves as a reminder

732
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.718
that we must not only give thanks
for our bounty,

733
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.952
but we must also defend it.

734
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.793
And in times of grave threat,
mount an aggressive offense

735
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.240
if America is to hang on to that trophy
of being the greatest nation on Earth.

736
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.000
Door left, door right!

737
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.357
- Got door right.
- Sykes! Foo, get them up!

738
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.312
Get up! Get up! Get the fuck up!

739
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.039
- Hurry up!
- Come on!

740
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.314
Don't fuckin' move!

741
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.511
Don't fuckin' move! You stay right there.

742
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.670
- Okay.
- You stay!

743
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.991
- Foo, check the back.
- Got it.

744
00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.997
- All clear.
- Room clear.

745
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.152
- Check that kitchen.
- Do you have any weapons?

746
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.519
No. He doesn't have anything.

747
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.593
He says to tell you there's nothing here.

748
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.990
Are you working
with the anti-coalition forces?

749
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.350
This is ridiculous. He is a simple man.
He's taking care of his family.

750
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.916
He is not the enemy.

751
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.515
Are you hiding anyone or anything?

752
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.677
- That's crazy. He's not...
- Look at this shit.

753
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.833
Come on. You just said you had no weapons.

754
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.874
It is a personal gun.
For personal use to defend his family.

755
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.679
There's no government, no law.

756
00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.872
You think I'm going to fight
the Americans with a pistol?

757
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.032
- Hey.
- And these papers?

758
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.949
He was a colonel in the military.

759
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.032
These are his personal things, his memories.

760
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.838
We got more houses to get to, Sergeant.

761
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.760
What's he saying?

762
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.830
Interpret!

763
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.440
Sorry, he's upset. He's not...

764
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.916
Hey, hey, hey, Sergeant, check this out.

765
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.315
Enough! Enough!

766
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.319
Zip them up and put them in the truck!

767
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.239
Do you not fear me?

768
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.152
I'm fuckin' serious... Get the fuck off!

769
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.392
Easy. Easy, man. Easy.

770
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.750
Go easy.

771
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.000
He says he knows once you take him
he's not coming back.

772
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.239
Tell them we're just going
to verify their identities.

773
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.595
Then they'll be brought back to their family.

774
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.315
So let's give 'em
a big-as-all-hell Texas welcome.

775
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.514
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

776
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.237
- Hey, what'll you have?
- How about an OJ?

777
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.470
Cool.

778
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.835
Thanks a lot, Joe.

779
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.678
- My man.
- Hell, yeah.

780
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.316
Hey, it's all coming together.
Just taking a little time.

781
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.512
Now, how you gonna finance this film?

782
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.557
We have a lot of interest in Hollywood.

783
00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.359
That's a problem, Albert.

784
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.032
The way I see it, Bravo's here,
and Hollywood is way the heck over there.

785
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.354
And frankly, I don't think these studio folks

786
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.717
have the moral fortitude
to grasp the true stakes of Bravo's story.

787
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.440
You have a point there, Norm.
You have a point.

788
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.951
What do you mean you don't disagree?
If you agree, then buy the thing.

789
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.235
If you disagree, then don't.

790
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.198
Because when you're telling me
you don't disagree,

791
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.511
what I hear is you don't have
an opinion whatsoever.

792
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.115
Sorry, ma'am. Just keep your hands
and feet away from their mouths

793
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.680
and you won't get hurt.

794
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.716
That's what I'm saying,
and you keep saying the same thing.

795
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.393
I mean, give me...

796
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.000
So, Billy, tell us about everything.

797
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.753
Dad, would you turn that shit off?

798
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.316
It's loud in here.

799
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.794
He doesn't need to be hearing
all this propaganda...

800
00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.996
Kathryn.

801
00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.560
They could cripple the economy,

802
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.838
force widespread quarantines,
and cause sickness and death.

803
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.594
So, how's it going?

804
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.959
It's weird.

805
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.796
I mean, we got rid of their dictator,

806
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.560
and now they're fighting each other
as well as us.

807
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.430
We're getting 'em sewer systems
and building schools,

808
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.233
and they don't even have textbooks.

809
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.035
We're soldiers.
What do we know about stuff like that?

810
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.956
I'm sure y'all are doing the best you can.

811
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.149
Yeah, with an illegal war

812
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.436
that we should've never started
in the first place.

813
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.639
What about all those WMDs
we keep hearing about?

814
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.638
You see any?

815
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.720
How about bringing democracy
to the country,

816
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.793
- is that working out...
- Kathryn, no politics at the table.

817
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.759
- We all know what that war is about.
- Yeah, right. The oil?

818
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.031
Like you know everything, Kat.

819
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.397
Like you're better
than all the people in Washington?

820
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.234
Yeah, I think if they want a war so bad,
they should fight it themselves.

821
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.353
It's not worth another American life,
especially not my brother's.

822
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.669
Kathryn.

823
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.877
- Your son.
- That's enough!

824
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.829
What's the matter, Albert?

825
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.195
Don't like cake?

826
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.953
Everybody in LA is eating turkey.

827
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.954
This is the part I hate, waiting around.

828
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.756
Know what I do over there to kill time?

829
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.554
I'm afraid to ask.

830
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.279
I imagine my kid.

831
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.795
Up here. I imagine playing with him, man.
It just levels me up.

832
00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.080
What you do over there? What's...
What's your specialty?

833
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.240
Communications.

834
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.596
And I'm telling you, AI, when I get out,

835
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.673
I could be like one of them IT guys
up in some office, man.

836
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.553
You got a skill, man.

837
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.679
I need one of them.

838
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.469
Hello.

839
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.711
How has Norm been treating you fellas?

840
00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.191
Excellent, sir.
Stadium cake's just out of this world.

841
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.595
Well, good. I just wanted to come over here
and tell you all how much I appreciate you.

842
00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.118
Oh, heck. I bet you boys have had
just about your fill of compliments by now.

843
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.559
No. We thrive on them, sir.
It's the compliments that keep us going.

844
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.718
You know, in the face
of the enemy's fanatical hatred.

845
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.274
A sense of humor is a powerful weapon.

846
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.033
My name is Wayne Pfister.

847
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.875
Pfister Oil & Gas. 100% family-owned.

848
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.597
We are digging deep to find
new sources of energy right here in Texas.

849
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:18.920
Extracting oil out of the Barnett Shale
with a process called "hydraulic fracturing".

850
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.480
See, some of my friends' kids
are servin' over there with y'all,

851
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.152
so it's a personal thing for me,
lessening our dependence on foreign oil.

852
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.836
I figure the better I do my job,

853
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.839
the quicker we can bring
you youngsters home.

854
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.110
Thank you, sir.

855
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.677
We certainly do appreciate your efforts.

856
00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.039
From your own perspective,

857
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.395
how do you think we're doing over there?

858
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.598
How are we doing?

859
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.072
Just from our own perspective?

860
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.918
Well, I'm far from qualified
to speak to the big picture, sir.

861
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.037
All I can tell you with any confidence

862
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.956
is that the exchange of force
with intent to kill...

863
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.833
That is truly a mind-altering
experience, sir.

864
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.756
I can only imagine how hard it is
to face that level of violence.

865
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.240
No.

866
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.193
We like going lethal.

867
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.511
I mean, isn't that
what you're paying us for, sir?

868
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.559
Take the fight to America's enemies
and send them straight to hell?

869
00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.831
If we didn't enjoy killing people,
what'd be the point?

870
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.759
Might as well send the Peace Corps in
to fight the war.

871
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.595
Well, I... I guess you got me there.

872
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.989
Sir, you see these men?

873
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.840
I don't know how they were
before the Army got them,

874
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.031
but you give them a weapon system
and a couple Red Bulls

875
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.873
and they'll blast the hell
out of anything that moves.

876
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.952
- Ain't that right, Bravo?
- Yes, Sergeant!

877
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.793
See what I mean, sir? They're killers.

878
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.599
They're having the time of their lives.

879
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.518
So if your company
wants to frack the living shit

880
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.474
out of the Barnett Shale, that's fine,
that's your prerogative,

881
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.080
but don't go doing it on our account.

882
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.958
You got your business, sir, and we got ours.

883
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.999
You just keep on drillin', sir,
and we'll keep on killin'.

884
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.869
Okay.

885
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.714
Okay.

886
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.679
I'm gonna go now.

887
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.120
Yo, Dave, after the Army, man,
you... You really should consider acting.

888
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.913
Dime ain't no act.
He just likes fucking with people.

889
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.639
What do you think acting is, man?

890
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.396
Damn it, Billy, why did I have to
give that nice man such a hard time?

891
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.153
Hard to say, Sergeant.

892
00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.511
Maybe I'm just an asshole?

893
00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.992
Maybe you are, Sergeant.

894
00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.831
Good man, Billy. Stay sharp.

895
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.593
- Hey, Mango.
- Yeah, buddy?

896
00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.558
I met somebody at the press conference.

897
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.314
- A cheerleader.
- Don't be an idiot, Billy.

898
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.074
I'm telling you, this girl and I...
We sort of connected.

899
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.560
Actually, we made out.

900
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.950
What? And then you banged her?

901
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.315
Man, this is serious.

902
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.074
I want to see her again,
get to know her better.

903
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.958
I hate to tell you this, Billy,
but you got to go for it

904
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.156
- right now, bro.
- Thanks for your service.

905
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.118
Thank you. 'Cause by the time we get back,

906
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.635
she's gonna be fucking
this big-ass linebacker.

907
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.189
Buddy, she's gonna be like,
"Ay! Ay! Billy who? Ay!"

908
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.556
- Fuck you, asshole.
- I'm just saying,

909
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.438
give her a call, man.

910
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.636
You... You don't have her number, do you?

911
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.677
Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.

912
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.433
Hey, what's up, vato?

913
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.398
Yeah, what's up, vato?

914
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.312
- Chillin', chillin'.
- Yeah. My friend Billy here

915
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.790
is feeling a little stress, you know?
Girl troubles.

916
00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.634
Hey, Billy. I'm Hector.
I got just the thing for that.

917
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.440
- Let's go outside.
- All right.

918
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.959
What is this place?

919
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.875
Nowhere, man.
One of them place that don't exist.

920
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.917
Good for smoke breaks.

921
00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.913
You think we should?

922
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.517
The hell are they gonna do, Billy,

923
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.159
send us to Iraq?

924
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.071
What's that all about?

925
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.720
- Norm's fancy-ass new stadium.
- It's huge.

926
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.871
This team hasn't made
the playoffs in, like, years.

927
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.952
- They suck.
- Doesn't matter.

928
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.760
Some folks pay tens of thousands of dollars.

929
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.231
- For seats?
- Just to reserve the right to buy seats.

930
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.993
Jesus.

931
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.234
Rich people. I don't get 'em.

932
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.199
They don't get you, either, Billy.

933
00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.000
Well... Thanks for sharing, my bro.

934
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.560
Appreciate it.

935
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.831
Hey, got to support the troops.

936
00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.036
Hooah.

937
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.312
You know, I'm thinking of signing up.

938
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.199
- For real?
- Yeah.

939
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.397
Well, I've got a kid and her mom,

940
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.437
and I want to take care of them and all,

941
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.991
but the way it is now,
it just isn't working out.

942
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.720
Once I'm in the Army,
won't have to worry about insurance.

943
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.589
Plus, they're offering
an enlistment bonus. Six thousand dollars.

944
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.194
Six...

945
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.476
They got my brown ass for free, Billy.

946
00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.074
They said, "Sign here, Mr. Montoya."

947
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.675
"Yes, of course. Here, take it."

948
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.479
I don't know why we're laughing.

949
00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.234
- That pretty much sucks.
- It definitely sucks.

950
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.755
- Yeah?
- Yeah. All those days I was over there,

951
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.674
I just kept thinking,
"I am so done with this shit."

952
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.229
You know? But then I'm like...

953
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.835
Okay, so when my time's up...

954
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.879
What the hell's waiting for me
here gonna be any better?

955
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.511
Like, working at Burger King,
you know? Fuck that.

956
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.919
That's when I remember
why I signed up in the first place, you know?

957
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.912
Exactly.

958
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.754
Yo, what I got out here sucks.

959
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.799
So, I might as well join.

960
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.430
- What else is there?
- What else is there?

961
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.114
What else is there?

962
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.599
Proudly we hailed

963
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:59.119
At the twilight's last gleaming

964
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.594
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

965
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:10.039
Through the perilous fight

966
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:15.639
O'er the ramparts we watched

967
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.591
Were so gallantly streaming

968
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.709
And the rockets' red glare

969
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:32.677
The bombs bursting in air

970
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.920
Gave proof through the night

971
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.992
That our flag

972
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.438
Was still there

973
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.076
O say does that

974
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.079
Star-spangled

975
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.960
Banner yet

976
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.760
Wave

977
00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.470
O'er the land of the

978
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.394
Free

979
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:14.632
And the home

980
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.316
Of the

981
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.995
Brave

982
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.790
Order arms!

983
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.874
We were flying home
with Shroom's body two weeks ago,

984
00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.032
and there were these

985
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.796
civilian contractors
in the front of the plane.

986
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.432
Bunch of chefs back from working
in the Green Zone for the big brass.

987
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.720
These guys made a ton of money in Baghdad,

988
00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.996
and they're all celebrating.

989
00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.959
Handing us drinks, and...

990
00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.238
It's like champagne and cigars.

991
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.833
And then there's Shroom in the back, just...

992
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.637
Just lying there, in...

993
00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.839
In his flag-covered box.

994
00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.880
You know?

995
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.079
You doing okay?

996
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.834
We're there.

997
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.357
We just try to
get through the day in one piece.

998
00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.477
I've been seeing this shrink.

999
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.518
He used to work at the VA hospital,

1000
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.877
- seeing a lot of soldiers...
- Kat. I'm fine.

1001
00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.752
You're "fine"?

1002
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.515
How?

1003
00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.998
Billy, what if you don't go back?

1004
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.434
Like I have a choice.

1005
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.920
You could.

1006
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.960
There are a ton of ways
you could get shipped home.

1007
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.316
Or at least out of active duty.

1008
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.390
I mean, you're a decorated hero, Billy.

1009
00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.233
You've done your part.

1010
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.439
There's no shame in it.

1011
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.079
I've done my research.

1012
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.117
- I made a commitment.
- To what?

1013
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.998
We both know exactly why you signed up.

1014
00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.197
Okay, well, I'm going back, Kat.

1015
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.072
If anything happens to you,
I'm gonna kill myself.

1016
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.510
Now, why would you do a thing like that?

1017
00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.120
'Cause you're, like,

1018
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.317
the last solid thing
we have left in this family.

1019
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.390
Come on, look at us.

1020
00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.314
That's pretty fucked up.

1021
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.954
It is fucked up.

1022
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.272
What do you say?

1023
00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.878
I'm going back, Kat.

1024
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.793
I have to.

1025
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.236
Hit him! Hit him!

1026
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.915
Get that motherfucker!
Get that motherfucker!

1027
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.435
Go! Go, go, go, go!

1028
00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.511
- Come on, D!
- Come on!

1029
00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.195
- Come on, D!
- Come on! Come on!

1030
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.233
D-line, you're getting blown back!

1031
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.232
Johnson hasn't
filled that gap in two seasons.

1032
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.232
Foo, you haven't filled the gap

1033
00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.039
- in, like, three years.
- Shut up.

1034
00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.554
Losers, you suck!

1035
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.074
Dude, can you show some respect?

1036
00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.833
I don't see you out there fighting for 'em.

1037
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.077
Take a seat, killing machine. You got this.

1038
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.994
Hello, Billy? Dr. Paul Schatten here.

1039
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.436
Your sister Kathryn asked me...

1040
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.240
Man, football is boring.

1041
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.392
What are you talking about?
Football kicks every other sports' ass.

1042
00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.233
There's, like, five seconds
of game play for ten minutes

1043
00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.516
of standing around checking in
on each other. Hi. How you doin'?

1044
00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.920
- You good?
- That's 'cause they're planning it out.

1045
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.753
Do you know how much thought and effort
goes into this shit?

1046
00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.910
How much thought...

1047
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.356
Hi. We got cut off.

1048
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.238
This is Dr. Paul Schatten.

1049
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.999
I know you're listening.

1050
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.799
Billy, your sister spoke to me.

1051
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.439
She's very concerned about you.

1052
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.230
I believe there's solid grounds
for taking you out of active duty.

1053
00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.870
Now, Kathryn will drive you
to the VA hospital right after the game.

1054
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.913
And I can put in a request for
a delay in your redeployment

1055
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.390
pending an honorable discharge hearing.

1056
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.120
I know this isn't an easy decision, Billy,

1057
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.237
but there's no dishonor in it.

1058
00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:37.200
Many returning soldiers suffer from PTSD
and are not diagnosed.

1059
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.554
The more courageous individuals
like you come forward,

1060
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.757
the more we can help others.

1061
00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.513
Billy...

1062
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.035
Please, think about it, okay?

1063
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.476
Call me if you have any questions.

1064
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.718
Goodbye, Billy.

1065
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.998
Asian! There are no Asians
or Latinos in football!

1066
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.639
Well, just try to watch a little bit.

1067
00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.315
- Okay, I'll watch. Okay. I'm sorry.
- You might learn a little thing or two.

1068
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.312
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be back.

1069
00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.075
Come on!

1070
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.231
And how are you enjoying your time here
in sunny Iraq, Private Lynn?

1071
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.996
- That's quite a question.
- And what's your answer?

1072
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.354
All right.

1073
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.796
This place sucks.

1074
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.314
People hate us.

1075
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.352
Nothing makes sense.

1076
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.999
I'd rather go home.

1077
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.514
"Go home"?

1078
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.274
Back in Texas, you were pretty much
a wall-to-wall fuck-up.

1079
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.433
Yeah, pretty much.

1080
00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.316
Look, I know this isn't
the most pleasant place

1081
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.835
for you to be spending
the flower of your youth,

1082
00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.191
but I'm beginning to think
you might have an aptitude

1083
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.953
for the soldiering business.

1084
00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.317
I've been watching you, Billy.

1085
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.355
When the shit hits the fan,
you're always on point.

1086
00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.079
And with this bunch of broke dicks,

1087
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.833
that's exactly what we need.

1088
00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.959
You belong here.

1089
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.720
You know, Shroom would probably say
some mumbo-jumbo horseshit about karma

1090
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.634
and everything happening
as it's been preordained.

1091
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.309
So, maybe there's a reason you're here.

1092
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.637
Think about it, Billy.

1093
00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:40.120
Gentlemen, a little gift from my man Hector.

1094
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.714
Okay?

1095
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.237
Hide that shit, hide that shit,
hide that shit.

1096
00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.915
- Hey, shitbirds, move over.
- All right, guys, get up.

1097
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.390
- Scoot one over for Albert.
- What's up, man?

1098
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.709
What's up? What's up?

1099
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.278
All right. So, where's
that big check there, buddy?

1100
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.760
What... What check?

1101
01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.069
I'm working on it.

1102
01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.634
- Hey, Albert, man.
- Yo.

1103
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:07.112
You know, we were wondering what's up
with the movie project, man.

1104
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.271
Seeing as we're about to head out to Iraq,

1105
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.113
to get shot at and all?

1106
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.159
- You got a studio yet, man?
- We do not. And Hilary's out.

1107
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.516
But there's still tons of interest out there.

1108
01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.913
Gonna get a little crazy
Just because I can, you know...

1109
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.515
So, which one is she?

1110
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.196
Third from left, down near the 20.

1111
01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.873
Till they throw me out...

1112
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.033
Congratulations, Billy.

1113
01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.793
Lady is bangin'.

1114
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.030
What's her name?

1115
01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.635
- Faison.
- "Faison". Damn.

1116
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.360
Depths and depths in young Billy.
Who'd have thought?

1117
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.477
Though how the hell you talked her into it...

1118
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.155
- I let her do most of the talking.
- Smart man.

1119
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.119
I got a feeling you're gonna
get laid a lot in life, Billy.

1120
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.919
Thanks, Sergeant.

1121
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.759
Thing is, I don't want to lose her.

1122
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.354
What?

1123
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.550
Jesus Christ, Billy, lose what?

1124
01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.597
How long were you with her, ten minutes?

1125
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.833
You're a hero. She was doing
something nice for the troops.

1126
01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.832
And we're on post as of 2200 tonight,

1127
01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.594
so I don't know when you think
you're gonna see her again.

1128
01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.391
- Do you have a problem?
- No, Sergeant.

1129
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.480
We're going back to Iraq, Billy.

1130
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.358
We're gonna be in the enemy's sights, and
you're gonna be the first one to get smoked

1131
01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.352
if you let your gun
get in the way of your rifle.

1132
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.639
Now, I want you to forget about
those pom-poms, and I mean fast.

1133
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.951
Every man's penis has the same IQ, Billy.

1134
01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.350
Be smarter than your penis.
Do I make myself clear,

1135
01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.113
- Specialist Lynn?
- Hooah, Sergeant.

1136
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.236
Good.

1137
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.232
Push it through, Dallas!

1138
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.797
Tell you what, why don't you get her e-mail?

1139
01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.236
That way y'all can e-fuck
when we're back in Iraq.

1140
01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.754
Enjoy the game.

1141
01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.280
Albert, switch with me.

1142
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.472
Classic Hollywood.

1143
01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.789
What?

1144
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.712
Old-time Hollywood films.

1145
01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.917
Movies about groups of men
working together fine,

1146
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.559
like you all, until some woman

1147
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.279
- comes in and messes it up.
- There's no woman.

1148
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.794
There's always a woman.
Without a love interest,

1149
01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.553
- there's no story.
- Yeah, well...

1150
01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.359
Dime set me right about that.

1151
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.713
Well, listen, brotherly love is a great
thing, but all these people in this stadium

1152
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.917
want to see you ride away
into the sunset with the girl.

1153
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.276
Without a woman, you ain't got shit, Billy.

1154
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.160
That's why I got married.

1155
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.357
Got to get your priorities straight.
Listen, don't worry,

1156
01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.318
we're gonna get this movie made right.

1157
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.550
Fuck 'em.

1158
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.799
- Fuck who?
- The studios.

1159
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.076
You guys keep protecting America,

1160
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.560
I'll keep pitching.

1161
01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.199
You guys are the real heroes, man.

1162
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.351
You guys deserve to get this movie made.

1163
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.160
I'm on... I'm on it. All good.
Don't worry about it.

1164
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.829
Everything is bigger and better in Texas,
and our cheerleaders...

1165
01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.151
Hey, hey, sorry to interrupt.
We need to get you guys ready

1166
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.436
- for halftime.
- Everyone here?

1167
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.592
Good. Okay. First off,
what are y'all gonna wear?

1168
01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.036
What we're wearing, ma'am.
These are our dress uniforms.

1169
01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.237
No way.
I'm already drowning in dress uniforms.

1170
01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.596
I need you boys
to really stand out, you know?

1171
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.353
Give me some of that "bring it on" attitude.

1172
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.159
You guys are gonna be right up there,

1173
01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.035
on stage with Destiny's Child.

1174
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.476
Excuse me, ma'am. Doing what?

1175
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.398
We don't have anything prepared.

1176
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.079
We'll go over it after you change.

1177
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.594
Right now, we've got wardrobe issues.

1178
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.718
- What else you got?
- Just our DCUs.

1179
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.871
That's our desert camouflage.

1180
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.998
Did you say "camo"? That's perfect!

1181
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.549
Josh, get these boys
battle-ready for halftime ASAP.

1182
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.552
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1183
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.112
- It's gonna be fine.
- "Battle-ready"?

1184
01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.873
Come on, it'll be great.
It'll be great. Let's go.

1185
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.276
- Let's go, guys.
- Okay, time to shine.

1186
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.995
Bravo 2-2. This is Bravo 2-6 Alpha.

1187
01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.912
Go ahead, Bravo 2-6.

1188
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.438
We have a civil affairs unit in contact,
vicinity Al-Ansakar village. Break.

1189
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.557
Looks like they're trying
to take hostages. Break.

1190
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.478
Move immediately to the east entrance

1191
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.115
and cover until BG4 arrives. How copy? Over.

1192
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.760
Roger that, Bravo 2-6. Over.

1193
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.036
Stand by for follow-on tasking.

1194
01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.794
Stay sharp, 2-2. Bravo 2-6 out.

1195
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.317
AI-Ansakar... We just built the school there.

1196
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.234
That's why the teenagers
keep shooting at us.

1197
01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.352
We don't know what's up there,
so hold the trucks here.

1198
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.432
We'll radio you after we assess.

1199
01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.474
LT wants us to secure that site
for a medevac when BG4 arrives.

1200
01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.119
Against the wall.

1201
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.197
- Come on.
- Enemy?

1202
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.599
I'm guessing the same militia shitheads
that shot up Charlie company last week.

1203
01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.871
Sergeant, is this it?

1204
01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.520
All good. Stay focused.

1205
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.638
Ladies, Hajji's gonna pop your cherry.

1206
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.153
And he's not the kind of guy
to take you to dinner first.

1207
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.551
These men are fighters.

1208
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.236
This is their house,
and you respect a man in his house.

1209
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.437
Now, warriors...

1210
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.910
Embrace your fear
and let your training guide you.

1211
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.400
We ready?

1212
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.718
All right.

1213
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.440
Scan your rooftops and watch your corners.

1214
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.032
I love you, Lynn.

1215
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.079
Roger that, Sergeant.

1216
01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.674
I love you, Sykes.

1217
01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.319
Copy, Sergeant.

1218
01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.712
I love you, Lodis.

1219
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.439
Word, Sergeant.

1220
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.557
- I love you, Crack.
- I love you.

1221
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.279
I love you, Mango.

1222
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.479
Yes, Sergeant.

1223
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.755
I love you, Foo.

1224
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.917
Love you, Sergeant.

1225
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.755
Yeah, yeah. Let's go get
a middle school named after us.

1226
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.669
They're looking for hostages again.

1227
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.989
Stay down!

1228
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.317
Fuck. They're creeping up on the left side.

1229
01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.471
Get to that wall. Day, stay on the left.

1230
01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.914
- Keep an eye on that two-story.
- Copy.

1231
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.760
Dime, set security on the right.
BG4's coming in that way.

1232
01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.035
- Yeah, all right.
- I'll take the first shot.

1233
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.520
Then get ready to move.

1234
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.637
Come on.

1235
01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.432
Ten! Nine!

1236
01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.799
Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four...

1237
01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.837
- Billy, I don't know about this.
- It's all good, Sykes.

1238
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.673
We're on the field. The stadium.

1239
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.638
Just follow me
and do everything I do, okay?

1240
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.353
Ladies and gentlemen, from Iraq,

1241
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.319
the heroes of the Battle of Al-Ansakar,

1242
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.551
- the pride of the United States...
- Like lambs to the slaughter.

1243
01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.875
I fuckin' knew it, man.

1244
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.634
The intrepid young soldiers of Bravo!

1245
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.910
Beyoncé!

1246
01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.709
Hit me!

1247
01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.551
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1248
01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.111
please welcome Kelly, Michelle and Beyoncé,

1249
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.476
the hit singing sensation,

1250
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.677
Destiny's Child!

1251
01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.074
Fuck! Fuck, man!

1252
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.197
It's okay. Keep going! Come on.

1253
01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.835
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1254
01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.069
Get the fuck off me!

1255
01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.197
I'm sorry, man. Just trying to help.

1256
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.514
It's just fireworks, dude! It's cool!

1257
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.875
Hey, man, this is all kinds of fucked up.

1258
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.792
- Twelve o'clock, what do you see?
- Shadows...

1259
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.600
Beyoncé. Destiny's fucking Child, dude,
right in front of you.

1260
01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.080
Ignore all the other shit.

1261
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.476
Keep your eyes focused
on the good stuff, all right?

1262
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.954
Let's go! Let's go!

1263
01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.398
Out of the way, please! Out of the way!

1264
01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.160
Come on.

1265
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.999
What the hell is going on?
Come on, let's stick together!

1266
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.072
- Sykes, are you all right?
- I'm fine, Sergeant.

1267
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.270
There you are!

1268
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.471
Okay, that was kind of hairy,
but you guys made it.

1269
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.711
Now, when this screen flies up,
I want you guys to step out

1270
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.154
and march down the stairs.

1271
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.840
And for you, you have an extra cue.
You know "Soldier"?

1272
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.673
The song Soldier.

1273
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.192
In the first bridge where they sing,
"They wanna spend that on me,"

1274
01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.352
that's your signal to move
to your special mark downstage.

1275
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.639
Now, here's the important part.
Once y'all hit your marks,

1276
01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.189
you have to stay absolutely still
until the show's over

1277
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.273
no matter what is going on around you.
Think you can manage?

1278
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.954
All right, let's get you
in a nice straight line.

1279
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.159
- Straight line.
- On your marks.

1280
01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.839
Come on, come on...

1281
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.031
What the fuck did she just say?

1282
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.192
I want a soldier

1283
01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.356
I want a soldier

1284
01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.751

That ain't scared to stand up for me

Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean

1297
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.871
If his status ain't hood

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.996
He's coming out of the back!

1322

Get some fuckin' fire on that building!

Fuck, yeah! I'm at reload!

1326

We knocked 'em back! We need to move out!

1327
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.591
Holliday, get the.50s up here
to cover our movement!

1328
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.672
- Let's go!
- Bravo team, on me!

1329
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.593
Put some smoke in their fuckin' faces!

1330
01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.599
Mango, Sykes, get their heads down!

1331
01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.192
- Smoke out!
- Smoke out!

1332
01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.710
Let's get ready to move!

1333
01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.995
Okay, let's go!

1334
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.475
Down to that rock pile and through the gate!

1335
01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.314
- Alpha team, when we move, shift fire!
- Hooah!

1336
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.672
Lynn, Foo, when we get to that pile,
throw everything you got on that gate!

1337
01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.036
Dime, you and Crack
start working your way to the wounded!

1338
01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.839
- Mango!
- Hooah!

1339
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.159
It's going down.

1340
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.273
What?

1341
01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.714
I'm going down.

1342
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.555
Shit!

1343
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.040
Damn it, where the fuck did that come from?

1344
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.074
Two o'clock in that building!

1345
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.992
Foo, prep those AT4s.

1346
01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.555
- Level that motherfucker!
- Roger that, Sarge!

1347
01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.519
Damn it, Sykes, get down!

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.633
- He's down there!

1349
01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.560
What the fuck?

1350
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.597
- Call out the building!
- Fuck.

1351
01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.712
Call out the building!

1352
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.314
He's hit!

1353
01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.871
- Shroom's been hit!
- Fire those motherfuckers now!

1354
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.469
Get those fuckers in there!

1355
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.755
Backblast area clear!

1356
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.309
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1357
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.478
Backblast area clear!

1358
01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.750
Fuck, yeah!

1359
01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.320
- Put that on my tab, motherfucker!
- Shut the fuck up!

1360
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.669
Crack, get down!

1361
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.433
- Okay!
- Bravo, on me!

1362
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.152
Let's push up, set security. Mango,

1363
01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.915
Sykes, cover our movement.
Get ready to move to Breem. On me.

1364
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.800
Goddamn it, Lynn! Cover him!

1365
01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.600
Hang in there, Sergeant.

1366
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.119
Medic!

1367
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.554
Billy.

1368
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.034
Hey, Billy.

1369
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.192
Halftime show's over.

1370
01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.238
Dude, we finally saw Beyoncé.

1371
01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.471
Yeah, well, ain't we fuckin' special.

1372
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.756
Sergeant, I feel bad.
That was some kind of fucked-up shit.

1373
01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.519
Just another normal day in America, Billy.

1374
01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.393
We strike the set in nine minutes.
You guys have to go.

1375
01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.830
Fuck off.

1376
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.553
Hey. I told you get the hell off my stage.

1377
01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.233
- Dude, don't touch me.
- Chill out, chill out.

1378
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.920
- Nobody told us where to go.
- Come on.

1379
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.713
I don't give a fuck where you go.
You can't stay here.

1380
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.359
Second half starts in nine minutes.

1381
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.071
All right, Rufus, I'll tell you what.

1382
01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.316
We'll go right after
you're done sucking my dick.

1383
01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.550
How about...

1384
01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.160
- What the fuck, man?
- Stand down!

1385
01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.396
Fuck off!

1386
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.670
- Hey, break it up!
- What the hell is going' on?

1387
01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.080
Fuckers didn't move when I asked them to.

1388
01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.435
We got fucking work to do!

1389
01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.757
I suggest you get back to it. Now.

1390
01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.431
- Fuck is wrong with you?
- We're good.

1391
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.354
I'm frankly astonished
to see our military behaving...

1392
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.794
Sir!

1393
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.235
Excuse me, sir.

1394
01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.631
That is so not the way we treat our guests.

1395
01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.473
These are American heroes,

1396
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.831
here at the personal invitation
of Mr. Norman Oglesby.

1397
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.632
We'll take charge now, thank you very much.

1398
01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.276
Come on, guys.

1399
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.478
- Nice work, dude.
- Hey, girl.

1400
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.750
- Hi.
- Sorry about that.

1401
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.274
- Hey, fellas.
- You're my best friend.

1402
01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.915
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

1403
01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.919
I can't believe
they just left y'all stranded there.

1404
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.629
And what happened to your nice uniforms?

1405
01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.514
Stage manager said we should look
more "battle-ready" for halftime.

1406
01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.514
Well, ready or not,
you still look pretty darn cute.

1407
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.750
Really?

1408
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.719
And you looked great.

1409
01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.678
That trippy little step
you were doing earlier.

1410
01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.513
- Come on.
- What's wrong with him?

1411
01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.432
Sykes is kind of an emotional guy.

1412
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.239
He just misses his wife and kids.

1413
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.476
The sacrifices you guys make.

1414
01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.400
Sometimes I wonder if we really deserve
what y'all are doing for us.

1415
01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.439
I mean, before I met you,
I'd be worried about

1416
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.196
silly little stuff like my car's engine
making a funny noise

1417
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.840
or my roommate's cat scratching up the sofa.

1418
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.750
While you're on the other side of the world,
getting shot at by folks

1419
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.031
who would just as soon
blow us all up to Kingdom Come.

1420
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.796
Well, ma'am, I guess that's just
what we're trying to prevent.

1421
01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.070
Billy, to have you come into my life,
it's just like...

1422
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.190
Five minutes, ladies.

1423
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.396
Shoot. Second half's starting.

1424
01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.193
Listen, why don't we stay in touch?

1425
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.599
Yeah. I mean...

1426
01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.156
Yes.

1427
01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.232
Yeah, I think, we should. Definitely yes.

1428
01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.710
Good.

1429
01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.837
Get out your phone,
I'll give you my information.

1430
01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.392
Then you can call me
and leave a message so I'll have yours.

1431
01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.154
'Cause, frankly, I do not want to lose you.

1432
01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.872
- What's your last name?
- Zorn.

1433
01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.871
I know. Everyone thinks it's funny.

1434
01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.799
It means "anger" in German.

1435
01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.075
Roger that.

1436
01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.075
You got a call from Kathryn.

1437
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.152
That's my sister.

1438
01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.390
- Okay, there's you.
- "Zorn."

1439
01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.639
Always last on everyone's list.

1440
01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.316
I'll change you to "Anger,"
that way you'll be first.

1441
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.070
- Sweetie.
- Faison, come on.

1442
01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.754
I gotta go.

1443
01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.750
You guys, I'm so sorry. I totally apologize.
That was 110% my fault.

1444
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.877
I don't know what happened. I am so sorry.

1445
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.078
We blew it. We just blew it because they
were supposed to bring you up immediately,

1446
01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.072
and then I was waiting for you
for, like, 20 minutes,

1447
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.230
and I don't really know what happened.

1448
01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.549
Josh, you hear about the fight we just had?

1449
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.955
- With the roadies?
- Wait.

1450
01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.759
Wait a second.
What do you mean, "fight"? Guys.

1451
01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.511
Joshy, Joshy, Joshy, it's good, man.
Relax, okay?

1452
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.751
- Hey.
- Jesus, Billy. I've been trying you.

1453
01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.195
I know. I'm sorry.

1454
01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.950
You know me,
banging all those cheerleaders.

1455
01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.634
Yeah, right.

1456
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.757
Listen, I'm on the freeway, okay?
I'm coming to get you.

1457
01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.513
Did Dr. Schatten
arrange that appointment yet?

1458
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.549
He left a message.

1459
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.473
- Look, Kat, you really think...
- No, I know. Trust me.

1460
01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.874
There's no way I'll let those fuckers
take my brother away.

1461
01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.637
- What are you laughing at?
- You.

1462
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.949
I should just take you with me.

1463
01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.993
You'd kick Hajji's ass.

1464
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.274
Listen, what you're about to do
is the right thing.

1465
01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.710
Billy, it's the right thing.

1466
01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.793
Just tell me where I can find you
after the game, and I'm there, okay?

1467
01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:43.870
All right.

1468
01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.913
Drive to the yellow loading area.

1469
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.356
- It's a black stretch Hummer.
- A stretch Hummer?

1470
01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.320
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that's us.

1471
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.519
But, Kat, I don't know.

1472
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.956
It'll be hard to leave the guys.

1473
01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.396
Just hold tight, Billy, okay?
I'll be right there.

1474
01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.230
Love you.

1475
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.400
Raise it. And praise it.

1476
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.510
We must let the world...

1477
01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.710
...that we will persevere.

1478
01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.117
- Hallelujah!
- Losers.

1479
01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.555
Come on.

1480
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.551
Dude, what the fuck happened to your eye?

1481
01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.793
Dude, what happened to your face?

1482
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.358
Hey, Travis, man.
Don't mess with these guys.

1483
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.030
These guys are the Bravos.

1484
01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.720
The what-hos?

1485
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.674
Yeah, I heard of you guys.

1486
01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.640
Goddamn. You're famous?

1487
01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.636
Tell me something, Bravos.

1488
01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.237
What do you think about gays in the military?

1489
01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.438
At least they got the balls to join.

1490
01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.878
I hear ya, dude, serving your country
and all that, very cool,

1491
01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.876
but guys blowing each other in foxholes?

1492
01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.280
That sounds kind of wack to me.

1493
01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.792
Like maybe it's got something to do with
why we're getting our butts kicked in Iraq.

1494
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.312
Shit, Billy, this guy seriously
needs to shut the fuck up.

1495
01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.755
- What?
- Yup.

1496
01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.876
I'll tell you what.

1497
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.710
Why don't you join up?

1498
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.639
Why don't you get in a foxhole with me
and see what happens?

1499
01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.360
Hey, man,
I'm just messing with you, all right?

1500
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.558
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"
I'm totally down with that.

1501
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.639
I don't give a shit if you guys are
gay, bi, tranny.

1502
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.833
You're the real American heroes.

1503
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.480
No? Whatever, man. It's cool.

1504
01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.991
I still support the troops. Go, Dallas!

1505
01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.719
- Let's go, guys.
- Yeah, Dallas!

1506
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.672
- So, how does that feel, baby?
- Okay.

1507
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.672
- Does that feel good? Yeah.
- That's funny, right?

1508
01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.638
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

1509
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.234
- Hey. Let go.
- This is one of the things we learn

1510
01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.118
in basic training
when we're not blowing each other.

1511
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.600
- Hey.
- That's right.

1512
01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.356
Relax, relax.

1513
01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.120
Hey, this is what happens
when you cut off the blood flow to the brain.

1514
01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.032
- Hey. Hey. Shut up.
- How's that feel?

1515
01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.270
He's fine. He's just joking.

1516
01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.510
That feel good, boy?

1517
01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.110
Hey, I'm just having a little fun here
with "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."

1518
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.351
- Do something.
- Arm down. Put your fucking arm down.

1519
01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.039
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Come on. He can't breathe.

1520
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.270
- Crack.
- He's gay?

1521
01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.870
Fucking asshole.

1522
01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.510
Travis. Travis, hey.

1523
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.553
- Hey, Travis. Come on.
- Hey, Travis, wake up!

1524
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.353
Would you wake up and give me a kiss, boy?

1525
01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.991
- Wake up, Travis. Come on.
- Come back anytime, okay?

1526
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.311
- Yo, Travis, wake up.
- Travis, babe.

1527
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.791
Travis, wake up.
Stand up. Stand up. Come on.

1528
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.639
- Sergeants.
- Anytime.

1529
01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.640
Hey, shut your mouth.

1530
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.310
- Something I should know about?
- Guy was mouthing off.

1531
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.995
Crack gave him some corrective training.

1532
01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.160
Okay, children, drink up.

1533
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.390
Y'all gotta get sharp.

1534
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.155
Hooah.

1535
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.159
He's pretty wasted there, Sergeant.

1536
01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.039
He'll be fine once he's back on base.

1537
01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.953
- It's the rest of us that I'm worried about.
- Look.

1538
01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.198
Push it through, Dallas!

1539
01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.670
Sergeant, if you had a choice,
would you go back?

1540
01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.516
To Iraq, I mean.

1541
01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.320
I don't have a choice, do I?

1542
01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.194
So your question lacks relevance.

1543
01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.999
- But if you did have a choice.
- But I don't.

1544
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.116
- But if you did.
- But I don't.

1545
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.873
- I'm just saying.
- Shut!

1546
01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.790
Do you wish we had a choice,
is that what you're asking?

1547
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.200
Well...

1548
01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.316
We don't, Sergeant.

1549
01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.159
That is correct, Specialist Lynn, we don't.

1550
01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.552
We're in the thick and deep
and all we have is each other.

1551
01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.036
That's why we need to keep our shit
high and tight,

1552
01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.349
and watch out...

1553
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.078
This better be good, Albert,
because we are runnin' out of fuckin' time.

1554
01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.800
Yeah?

1555
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.639
Are you available for a meeting?

1556
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.520
Am I what?

1557
01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.993
- Sure. When?
- Now, with Norm.

1558
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.039
Albert says Norm wants to make our movie.

1559
01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.952
- Holy shit.
- What?

1560
01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.919
Albert comes through in the clutch.

1561
01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.955
After all that bullshit,
the man keeps his word, shit.

1562
01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.514
I just hope Hilary Swank

1563
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.670
- thinks about playing Billy again.
- Shut up.

1564
01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.479
Come on, Billy. We're on our way.

1565
01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.079
Could you please tell Mr. Oglesby
that they're here?

1566
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.793
- Thank you.
- I'll tell him. I'll tell him.

1567
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.234
Yo.

1568
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.680
All right, guys, here's the deal.

1569
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.355
I've been talking to Norm. He's inspired.

1570
01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.796
He's all over Bravo.
He wants to make the picture.

1571
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.474
Might as well. His team sure sucks.

1572
01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.230
He wants to do it right.

1573
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.391
The only thing is, he has a little
problem with the option price.

1574
01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.598
Hundred thousand for eight men.

1575
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.190
- That's a lot of cash.
- Hear that, Billy?

1576
01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.395
What's that, Sergeant?

1577
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.880
That's the sound of us getting fucked.

1578
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.314
Dave, have some faith, man.

1579
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.792
Look, Norm ain't no...
He ain't no Santa Claus.

1580
01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.234
We all know that. In fact, they floated
around an idea of making you two the stars

1581
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.390
- and forgetting about the others.
- No.

1582
01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.640
That's what I said.
I said Bravo lives by the warrior code.

1583
01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.120
You guys don't leave anyone behind.

1584
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.520
Show some goddamn respect, Albert.

1585
01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.156
I got nothing but, Dave. Nothing but.

1586
01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.398
I'm on your team, okay? Relax.

1587
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.915
I am relaxed. Billy's relaxed, too.

1588
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.639
- Aren't you, Billy?
- Totally relaxed, Sergeant.

1589
01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.558
- He's totally relaxed.
- Okay, hang with me.

1590
01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.472
Guys, I'm gonna get you there, okay?

1591
01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.518
So, right now what they're offering is,

1592
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.393
you'll be deferring monies up front

1593
01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.597
against a net profit percentage
on the back end.

1594
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.155
How much?

1595
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.150
It ain't a lot to start with.

1596
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.358
- $5,500 against the profits.
- Fifty-five fucking hundred?

1597
01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.313
You said 100,000 up front.

1598
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.952
I said "possibly."
You guys had major heat coming in.

1599
01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.314
But two weeks?
That's like two years in Hollywood time.

1600
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.520
It breaks my heart to say, man,
but people move on.

1601
01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.114
"People move on."

1602
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.074
People move on.

1603
01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.193
Everybody supports the troops.

1604
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.792
Hell, yeah, "We're so fucking
proud of our troops,"

1605
01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.758
but when it comes to actual money,

1606
01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.275
then all of a sudden
we're stuck in everybody's tight-ass budget.

1607
01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.636
Talk is cheap, I get that. Talk is cheap.

1608
01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.074
But money screams.

1609
01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.512
This is our country, guys, and I fear for it.

1610
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.714
I think we should all fear for it.

1611
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.515
I do, Dave. I truly do.

1612
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.800
Yeah, right.

1613
01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.714
So you're saying
this is the best offer we got?

1614
01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.152
I'm saying this is the only offer we got.

1615
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.430
I got to call the men.

1616
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.549
Holliday.

1617
01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.759
Will you ask the guys
what they think of $5,500 apiece?

1618
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.551
...fucking apiece, guys. What do you think?

1619
01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.991
- Fuck that!
- He can kiss my fucking brown ass!

1620
01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.596
Your thoughts, Billy?

1621
01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.113
What do you think we should do?

1622
01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.434
- I...
- Look, Dave...

1623
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.394
If you think you can do better,
you come talk to the man.

1624
01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.274
Come on.

1625
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.274
Mr. Oglesby.

1626
01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.513
We got a goddamn hole in the fence!

1627
01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.956
- What's he doing calling trips right 90 jet?
- Okay.

1628
01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.153
They were in Cover 2. We run 494 bingo.

1629
01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.914
- That's what we do.
- Run 494 bingo. Screen pass...

1630
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.672
Well, gentlemen, welcome to the War Room.

1631
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.753
I apologize for today.
Not our most stellar effort.

1632
01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.638
I hate to lose.

1633
01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.712
Rather cut off my little finger than lose.

1634
01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.676
Well...

1635
01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.351
Maybe we'll turn it around in the fourth.

1636
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.677
So, Albert, you tell our friends
about our plans for their film?

1637
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.752
- I sure did.
- Let's face it,

1638
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.070
a lot of people
are discouraged about this war.

1639
01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.916
They forget that some things
are actually worth fighting for.

1640
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.195
Please sit down.

1641
01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.274
Now, I think Bravo's story

1642
01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.558
will go a long way toward reinvigorating
our commitment to this war.

1643
01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.710
Now, I'm not interested
in making a good movie.

1644
01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.355
I want to make something great.

1645
01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.635
What makes you think you can?

1646
01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.480
Pardon?

1647
01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.634
Can you deliver, sir?

1648
01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.672
You want to buy our story for 5,500 bucks.

1649
01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.712
That sure sounds like chump change to me.

1650
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.793
Hell, my granny could swing that deal
with a trip to the ATM.

1651
01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.113
With all due respect, Mr. Oglesby,
show us you're serious.

1652
01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.960
Show us you're a player.

1653
01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.272
Look around you, son.

1654
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.078
Look around and think for a moment
about everything you see.

1655
01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.472
Take a good, hard look...

1656
01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.598
And you tell me, am I a player?

1657
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.874
Now, we need maximum flexibility
to get this movie together.

1658
01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.560
But your risk won't be greater than it is
for any other investor, myself included.

1659
01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.672
May I speak frankly, sir?

1660
01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.913
Why stop now?

1661
01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.073
We're soldiers, sir.

1662
01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.518
We feel like we've already got
enough risk in our lives.

1663
01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.393
Now, I understand that 100,000

1664
01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.073
might have been
an overly optimistic number,

1665
01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.150
but after all they've been through,

1666
01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.590
my men don't deserve to be stuck
in somebody's bottom line.

1667
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.592
Now, if you can just find it in your heart...

1668
01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.240
Sergeant Dime, my offer stands.

1669
01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.316
Now, it may not be as much as
you fellas were hoping for,

1670
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.234
but from what I hear,
it's the only offer you've got.

1671
01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.713
And I think most people agree
something is better than nothing.

1672
01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.360
"Something" would be nice.

1673
01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.916
"Something" would be great.

1674
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.834
But it's just...

1675
01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.240
I don't know, sir.

1676
01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.954
It's just so sad.

1677
01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.914
We thought you kind of liked us.

1678
01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.910
But I do.

1679
01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.554
I do like you.

1680
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.912
I think the world of you fine young men.

1681
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.874
See, Billy? He does like us.

1682
01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.270
He likes us so much
he's gonna fuck us in the face.

1683
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.398
Hey, hey. The sergeant and I
need to have a little talk.

1684
01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.873
You don't have to go, Billy.

1685
01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.952
Let Sergeant Dime cool off a bit.

1686
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.073
Could you excuse us for a moment?

1687
01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.311
Dime is direct. I appreciate that.

1688
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.754
Even if his language
is a bit salty for my taste.

1689
01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.637
So I'm gonna be straight with you, that okay?

1690
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.552
It's a free country, sir.

1691
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.950
That's right. Freest in the world.

1692
01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.073
And with that freedom
comes responsibilities.

1693
01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.597
Now, what you did that day
at AI-Ansakar Canal

1694
01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.160
was caught on camera, Billy.

1695
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.032
And for many folks,
that's where the war became real.

1696
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.272
But for us, the war's always been real, sir.

1697
01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.316
- And we never needed cameras to tell us that.
- Of course.

1698
01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.156
You know, I was never tested
like you've been, Billy.

1699
01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.871
Young man forged in the crucible of war.

1700
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.992
I never did get to Vietnam.

1701
01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.549
You know things
most of the rest of us will never know.

1702
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.357
That kind of friendship,

1703
01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.432
the taste of death
in the back of your throat,

1704
01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.873
your enemy going limp
with a final twist of the knife.

1705
01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.520
Well, anyway,

1706
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.799
what I'm trying to say is,

1707
01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.440
I can't begin to imagine
what you went through personally.

1708
01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.354
Thank you for saying that, sir.

1709
01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.000
And being celebrated as a hero,

1710
01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.311
that's got to weigh heavy
on a young man's shoulders.

1711
01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.550
Makes me feel like
I've got no say in things, sir.

1712
01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.560
I sympathize.

1713
01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.511
But your story, Billy...

1714
01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.513
You got to understand,
it no longer belongs to you.

1715
01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.592
It's America's story now.

1716
01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.919
That's what this country's built on.

1717
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.560
You take this great state of Texas,

1718
01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.512
cattle, land, oil.

1719
01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.913
Those things made us rich.

1720
01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.120
But what made us Texas
is the story of some local boys

1721
01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.795
that made a valiant stand at the Alamo.

1722
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.193
And so it is with this war, Billy.

1723
01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.471
It's all about ideas.

1724
01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:04.680
Your battle foreshadows America's triumph
over the forces of terror.

1725
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.392
Bravo is us.

1726
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.590
And that's why you got to get your boys
to accept my offer.

1727
01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.996
Glad to have you back, Sergeant Dime.

1728
01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.671
Billy and I have been having
a little man-to-man.

1729
01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.910
He's wrong, Sergeant.

1730
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.030
Who's wrong?

1731
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.430
You are, Mr. Oglesby, sir.

1732
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.080
What I did, what we did,
isn't just some story or idea.

1733
01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.873
It's our lives.

1734
01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.679
You've got no clue what it means.

1735
01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.753
You just... You want to turn it
into something it's not.

1736
01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.519
We wouldn't cut a deal with you
even if you weren't such a tightwad.

1737
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.834
I mean, Hajji has more respect for us
than you do.

1738
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.869
Sometimes nothing is better than something.

1739
01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.919
And about the Alamo?

1740
01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.711
Mexico kicked Texas' ass.

1741
01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.157
All due respect, sir.

1742
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.712
Well, sir, Bravo's spoken.

1743
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.634
Let's go, Billy.

1744
01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.320
I think our business is done here.

1745
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.392
- We'll form up in the loading area.
- I'll let the driver know.

1746
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.159
Hey. Billy.

1747
01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.800
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1748
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.594
Hey, Billy.

1749
01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.591
I thought a bathroom break was in order.

1750
01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.474
Give Norm a little space.

1751
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.719
I got to say, though, Billy,

1752
01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.520
the way you stood up
to that arrogant prick in there,

1753
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.150
now, that, that's what we call in my world
"a real movie moment".

1754
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.831
I don't know, maybe I was just talking shit.

1755
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.638
The truth is, for most of the guys,
something is better than nothing.

1756
01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:54.872
No. You got to do what you know is right,
and that sure in the hell wasn't right.

1757
01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.239
What you guys go through, Billy,

1758
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.198
it's real hard for us over here to get it,

1759
01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:02.000
but we need to get it,
and the country needs to get it.

1760
01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.670
Yeah.

1761
01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.312
Well, I'm sorry for wrecking your deal.

1762
01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.432
I know how hard you work for us.

1763
01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.989
No. Getting the offer is bad enough.

1764
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.840
Hard part is making a decision,
and that's on you.

1765
01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.117
We gonna get this done,
and we gonna get it done right.

1766
01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.112
I just got to start thinking outside the box.

1767
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.317
Hell, I'll go to China if I have to.

1768
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.876
So you guys just take care over there, now.

1769
01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.589
We'll talk soon.

1770
01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.080
I'm on it. It's all good.

1771
01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.550
- I'm sorry, guys.
- It's cool, man.

1772
01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.280
I know you've been looking out for us.

1773
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.919
Taking one for the team.

1774
01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.000
Yeah, you the man, Billy Lynn.

1775
01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.874
- You okay, Billy?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

1776
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.551
Fuck it. Better this movie not get made, man.

1777
01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.712
Shit, with Bravo starring,
people'll get so pumped up about the war,

1778
01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.269
they'd keep redeploying our asses
back to Iraq, you know?

1779
01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.034
- Wait, Sergeant, nobody's seen Major Mac.
- He'll show.

1780
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.074
There goes those fucking
asswipe dickheads again.

1781
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.992
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, guys, guys, guys!

1782
01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.400
- Hey, come on, now.
- Back down! Back down!

1783
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.073
- Come on. Come on.
- Back up, you guys.

1784
01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.480
- Come on, guys.
- Get back to work.

1785
01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.115
Let's go. They're not worth it. Let's go.
Let's go. You all right?

1786
01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.190
- Get back to work.
- Everyone okay?

1787
01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.475
Hey, Josh, where's your kit?

1788
01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.989
What do you mean?

1789
01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.355
You're rolling with Bravo now, man.

1790
01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.517
- Yeah, one of us, going to Iraq, man.
- Come on,

1791
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.398
- I'm just gonna take you, 'cause I like you.
- No, no, no.

1792
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.560
Boys, okay, that's my undercarriage.

1793
01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.438
Josh, man, you got to learn how to fight.

1794
01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.638
- Hey. Where are you?
- Near the yellow loading area.

1795
01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.552
I'm almost there. Hang on.

1796
01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.240
I see you. I see you.

1797
01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.953
God, why do you have to go?

1798
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.474
No sacrifice too great. Duty first.

1799
01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.757
Geez, I can't believe I just said that.

1800
01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.632
I need you, Billy Lynn.

1801
01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.792
Well, you can have me. Anytime.

1802
01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.310
I'd like that.

1803
01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:19.472
I'd like any minute I can get with you.

1804
01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.710
Girl...

1805
01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.317
I'd just about run away with you.

1806
01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:50.915
"Run away"?

1807
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.992
But y'all are getting redeployed.

1808
01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.194
You're a decorated hero.

1809
01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.955
Right. Of course.

1810
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.273
I was just kidding.

1811
01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.391
Well, I still got a long walk
ahead of me, so...

1812
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.716
I guess I better get going.

1813
01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.799
I'll pray for you.

1814
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.549
- Shut up.
- Thought we lost you there, Billy.

1815
01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.070
No?

1816
01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.633
Suck my dick, you bunch of shits!

1817
01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.751
I'll fucking kill you, you fucking shit!

1818
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.632
Get off! Get off me!

1819
01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.269
I'm going down.

1820
01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.150
Boys!

1821
01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.596
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

1822
01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.232
Stand down. Stand the fuck down.

1823
01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.670
Fuck off.

1824
01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.200
Sarge?

1825
01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.274
Sarge?

1826
01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.315
Take them out!

1827
01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.079
Cover that fucking building.

1828
01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.557
Fuck! Lynn!

1829
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:30.789
He's gone, Sergeant.

1830
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.678
Fuck. Come on, buddy.

1831
01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.712
Come on, Shroom. Come on, buddy.

1832
01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:43.600
I knew it'd be you, man.

1833
01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.478
I fucking knew it'd be you.

1834
01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.313
I am so fuckin' proud of you.

1835
01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:55.196
Hey, Billy. You still with us?

1836
01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.914
Yes, Sergeant.

1837
01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.429
I'm not flaking on you.

1838
01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.751
Good. I'm gonna need you, Billy.

1839
01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.316
You got to help me
keep these clowns alive, okay?

1840
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.914
Come on.

1841
01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.191
All right, 2nd Squad, let's move on out.

1842
01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.114
Okay, boys, your duffels, and your footballs,
are in the car already.

1843
01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.475
It's been a pleasure.

1844
01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:20.909
Real bad-ass, Josh...

1845
01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:23.634
Right back in time.

1846
01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.360
One minute.

1847
01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.354
Hey.

1848
01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.912
Looking like I might die a virgin.

1849
01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.916
That's really fucking hilarious, Billy.

1850
01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.550
I'm going back, Kat.

1851
01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.836
Good. You go back.

1852
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.712
Trashing another country's easy.

1853
01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.113
Standing up to your own...

1854
01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.713
That would take a real hero.

1855
01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.794
It's not fair, Kat.

1856
01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.473
It's not fair.

1857
01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.952
Nothing's fair.

1858
01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.633
I'm not a hero, Kat.

1859
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.314
I'm a soldier.

1860
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.872
That's what Shroom taught me.

1861
01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.474
That's where I belong.

1862
01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.079
I'm not saying it's right,
but it's not wrong, either.

1863
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.480
It just is.

1864
01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:09.313
I just wish there was some goddamn way
I could make you proud of me.

1865
01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.152
I'm always proud of you.

1866
01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.360
I love you.

1867
01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.596
So, here you are, Billy.

1868
01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.234
Yeah.

1869
01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.590
I guess I always have been.

1870
01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:57.192
You know, I've been thinking
these past two weeks

1871
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.158
that I know something.

1872
01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.833
Something that civilians don't know,

1873
01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.159
but you know what?

1874
01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.357
They're the ones running this show.

1875
01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.954
I mean, I've lived the damn war,

1876
01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.115
but it's still their war. Isn't it?

1877
01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.360
Their movie.

1878
01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:18.349
We're a nation of children, Billy.

1879
01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.591
We go somewhere else to grow up,

1880
01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:22.160
sometimes die.

1881
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.472
It's your time to step up.

1882
01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.634
Remember,

1883
01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.952
the bullet's already been fired.

1884
01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.393
Yeah.

1885
01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.680
I'm ready, Sergeant.

1886
01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.874
I love you.

1887
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.320
I love you.

1888
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.834
I love you.

1889
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.679
I love you, man.

1890
01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.956
- I love you.
- I love you.

1891
01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.237
- I love you.
- I love you.

1892
01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.833
What do you want me to say?

1893
01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.234
I love you, too.

1894
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.799
We're good. Let's roll.

1895
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.753
- Hell, yeah.
- And get us the fuck out of here.

1896
01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.152
Yeah, before they kill us.

1897
01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.477
Take us someplace safe.

1898
01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.074
Take us back to the war.

1899
01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.478
Take us home.

1900
01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.396
Seat belts, ladies.
