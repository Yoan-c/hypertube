2
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:37.251
Good morning, Mr Blake. My name's Amanda.

3
00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.499
I've got a couple of questions
here for you today

4
00:00:39.624 --> 00:00:43.134
to establish your eligibility for
Employment Support Allowance.

5
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.461
It won't take up much of your time.

6
00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:48.296
Could I just ask firstly,

7
00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:52.005
can you walk more than 50 metres
unassisted by any other person?

8
00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:53.853
- Yes.
- Okay.

9
00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:58.015
Can you raise either arm as if to
put something in your top pocket?

10
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.940
I've filled this in already
on your 52-page form.

11
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.560
Yeah, I can see that you have

12
00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.029
but, unfortunately,
I couldn't make out what you had said there.

13
00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:08.532
Yes.

14
00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:14.954
Can you raise either arm to the top of
your head as if you are putting on a hat?

15
00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.334
I've telt you, there's nowt wrong
with me arms and legs.

16
00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:19.374
Could you just answer
the question, please.

17
00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:20.747
Well, you've got me medical records.

18
00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:22.464
Can we just talk about me heart?

19
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.459
D'you think you could
just answer these questions?

20
00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:27.047
Okay.

21
00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:30.428
So was that a yes, that you
can put a hat on your head?

22
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.260
- Yes.
- Okay, that's great.

23
00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:38.982
Can you press a button
such as a telephone keypad?

24
00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:41.638
There's nowt wrong with me fingers either.

25
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.190
I mean, we're getting farther
and farther away from me heart.

26
00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:47.114
If we could just keep
to these questions, thank you.

27
00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:49.404
Do you have any significant difficulty

28
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:52.067
conveying a simple message to strangers?

29
00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:56.077
Yes. Yes, it's me fucking heart.
I'm trying to tell you but you'll not listen.

30
00:01:56.493 --> 00:01:59.873
Mr Blake, if you continue
to speak to us like that

31
00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:02.786
that's not gonna be very helpful
for your assessment.

32
00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:05.416
If you could just answer
the question, please.

33
00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:07.214
- Yes.
- Okay.

34
00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:17.104
Do you ever experience any loss of control
leading to extensive evacuation of the bowel?

35
00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:19.018
No. But I cannot guarantee

36
00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:21.178
there won't be a first if we divvent
get to the point.

37
00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:26.109
Can you complete a simple
task of setting an alarm clock?

38
00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.399
Oh, Jesus. Yes.

39
00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.318
Can I ask you a question?
Are you medically qualified?

40
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:34.861
I'm a health care professional

41
00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.409
appointed by the
Department of Work and Pensions

42
00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:41.124
to carry out assessments for
Employment and Support Allowance.

43
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.331
But there was a bloke out in the,
er, in the waiting room,

44
00:02:44.457 --> 00:02:46.667
he says that you work
for an American company.

45
00:02:46.793 --> 00:02:49.343
Our company's been
appointed by the Government.

46
00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:51.554
Are you a nurse? Are you a doctor?

47
00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:53.423
I'm a health care professional.

48
00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:58.014
Listen, I've had a major heart attack.

49
00:02:58.137 --> 00:02:59.967
I nearly fell off the scaffolding.

50
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.770
I wanna get back to work, too.

51
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.900
Now, please, can we talk about me heart?

52
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.610
Forget about me arse, that works a dream.

53
00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:48.515
Piper, you lazy bastard.

54
00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.686
Will you get out of bed
and do some housework!

55
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.940
China!

56
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:54.192
China!

57
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.116
Sorry, Dan, just got a text
to go to work. I'm late.

58
00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:59.316
Did you enjoy your chicken tikka masala?

59
00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.409
- How did you know that?
- Cos I can bloody smell it.

60
00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:04.204
How many times have I told you about
leaving rubbish lying about the place,

61
00:04:04.287 --> 00:04:05.367
stinking it up?

62
00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:08.116
- Can I dump it later? I'm running late.
- No. Now!

63
00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:12.047
Dan...

64
00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:14.462
Erm, I've got a big favour to ask

65
00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:17.508
I'm expecting a package. Really important.

66
00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.512
They've changed my hours, so I won't be in.

67
00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:21.136
Can you keep an eye out for the postman?

68
00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:24.433
If you swear nae more rubbish.

69
00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:28.559
- Catch!
- Don't you fucking dare.

70
00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.225
- I'll kick your arse into next week.
- Okay.

71
00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:34.225
Daft as a bloody brush.

72
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:51.424
When can I go back to work?

73
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:53.671
Ah, not yet, that's for certain.

74
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:56.301
You're making progress.

75
00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:02.849
I think if we just
continue you on the same dosage.

76
00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:05.262
And, yeah, rehab exercise.

77
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.187
We'll see if we can
the pumping capacity to increase.

78
00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:09.687
- Yeah.
- And it might.

79
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.690
But if not, we might need to look
at fitting you with a defibrillator.

80
00:05:15.984 --> 00:05:19.074
Keep up with the exercise, keep moving.
That's gonna build you up.

81
00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:20.908
But you need to be rested as well.

82
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.030
Well, I'm a bit of a night owl, you know.

83
00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:25.204
I got into the habit
when I was looking after the missus

84
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:26.664
before she passed away.

85
00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.995
How you doing, son? How you doing?

86
00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:37.094
- All right.
- How's the old ticker?

87
00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:38.843
Ah, you know, me marathon days are over.

88
00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:41.085
But, you know,
I'll be fine in a month or two.

89
00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:43.217
Ah, well, be leaving that Viagra alone.

90
00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:44.223
I'll keep it for you, shall I?

91
00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:46.813
Aye, I probably need it more than you.

92
00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:52.774
Right, well, owt you want here?

93
00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:56.983
- Have a look
- Oh, that's nice, aye.

94
00:05:57.483 --> 00:06:00.323
Meranti, aye, African Meranti.
It's great, man.

95
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:04.121
So, er, d'you reckon
you'll get back to Ferguson's?

96
00:06:05.116 --> 00:06:06.276
Depends on the work, I suppose.

97
00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:08.447
I mean, you know what it's like.
It's up and down.

98
00:06:08.578 --> 00:06:09.618
Aye, well.

99
00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:11.999
Gotta see this.

100
00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:20.917
There you go.

101
00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:23.009
Oh, that's a lovely piece.

102
00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:27.392
Aye, I'll have the...
I'll have the lads drop it by for you.

103
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:30.428
Erm, are you all right?

104
00:06:31.184 --> 00:06:32.524
I'm on the mend.

105
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:36.145
I mean, I can get your shopping
sorted out for you, you know.

106
00:06:36.272 --> 00:06:38.272
Like, the heavy stuff and that,
like, it's nae bother.

107
00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:41.067
Thanks, Joe.
You know, I like to get out and about.

108
00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:42.364
Gives us something to do.

109
00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:44.856
Well, give us a shout if you need anything.

110
00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:46.779
I mean, I mean that.

111
00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:49.366
You, you gave us a big fright, you know.

112
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.850

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:46.554

Morning, mate.
Got a package for Mr Max Million.

142
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.750
- "Mr Max Million"?
- Yeah. Mr Max Million.

143
00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:25.084
My address?

144
00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:26.844
Yeah, definitely this address.

145
00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:29.633
- Where's it from?
- China.

146
00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:31.674
Oh. Give it here.

147
00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:36.515
D'you know how long
I've been on this phone?

148
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.175
One hour, forty-eight minutes.

149
00:10:38.306 --> 00:10:41.426
Jesus Christ, that's longer than
a football match. It'll cost a fortune.

150
00:10:42.018 --> 00:10:44.098
I'm sorry, sir, but it's been very busy.

151
00:10:44.437 --> 00:10:45.597
There must be some mistake.

152
00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:47.518
I've got a serious heart condition.

153
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:50.226
I'm in rehab and the doctor's
told us I cannae go back to work.

154
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:53.696
Now, I was getting the benefits
fine until that bloody assessment.

155
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:57.072
I see you've only
scored twelve points, er,

156
00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:58.909
and you need 15 to obtain benefits.

157
00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:01.115
Oh, points, that's your game?

158
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:03.959
I'm sorry, sir,
but according to our health, er,

159
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:05.544
health care professional,

160
00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:07.084
you've been deemed fit for work.

161
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.050
So she knows better than my doctor,

162
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:12.841
a consultant surgeon and a physio team?

163
00:11:13.632 --> 00:11:15.632
Well, I wanna appeal.

164
00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:19.256
Well, that's fine, but you'll have to first
request a mandatory reconsideration.

165
00:11:20.264 --> 00:11:21.934
What the bloody hell does that mean?

166
00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:24.636
It means the decision
maker will reconsider it

167
00:11:24.727 --> 00:11:27.687
and if he comes to the same
decision, you can then appeal.

168
00:11:28.314 --> 00:11:29.904
Right, well put us down for that, then.

169
00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:31.904
Okay, sir, but you must wait

170
00:11:32.026 --> 00:11:33.646
to get a call from the decision maker.

171
00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:35.318
Why?

172
00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:38.025
To tell you what the decision is.

173
00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:40.527
But that's already been decided.

174
00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:43.945
It is, but you're supposed to get the call,

175
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.540
before the letter.

176
00:11:45.664 --> 00:11:47.334
Well, is he gonna change his mind?

177
00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:49.916
No, the call's just to discuss the decision.

178
00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:53.798
Well, I know what the decision is,
I've got the letter here in front of us.

179
00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:55.673
D'you want us to read it to you?

180
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.800
But he should have called you first.

181
00:11:57.927 --> 00:11:59.217
But he didn't.

182
00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:01.175
But he should have.

183
00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:03.595
Well unless we've got a time machine,
we're pretty much knackered,

184
00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:05.062
divvent you agree?

185
00:12:05.476 --> 00:12:06.636
Er, he has to call you first, sir.

186
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:08.347
Listen,

187
00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:12.685
can you not just put him on now,
so I don't have to waste any more time?

188
00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:14.685
I can't do that, sir.

189
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.489
Where is he?

190
00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:18.405
He'll give you a call back when he, er,

191
00:12:18.531 --> 00:12:20.701
- he gets the chance.
- When?

192
00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:22.989
I don't know, sir.

193
00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:26.122
This is ridiculous, man.

194
00:12:45.141 --> 00:12:47.481
On the one hand, Jobseeker's Allowance,

195
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.481
only for those able and ready to work.

196
00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:53.073
But if you're ill, you have to apply
for Employment and Support,

197
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.940
get an assessment carried out.

198
00:12:55.443 --> 00:12:57.453
Well, I've done that
but they've knocked us back.

199
00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.486
Right, well if you've been
deemed fit for work,

200
00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.743
your only option is Jobseeker's Allowance.

201
00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:03.834
Or proceed with the appeal on
Employment and Support.

202
00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:06.248
Well, can you give me a form for...

203
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.790
You know, erm, Jobseeker's Allowance

204
00:13:07.913 --> 00:13:10.333
and then an appeal form
Employment and Support?

205
00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:11.828
You have to apply online, sir.

206
00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.039
I cannot do that.

207
00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.506
Well that's how it is, sir.
Or you can phone the helpline.

208
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.677
Listen, you know,
you give me a plot of land,

209
00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.087
I can build you a house.

210
00:13:20.217 --> 00:13:22.681
But I've never been
anywhere near a computer.

211
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:24.683
D'you know what, we're digital by default.

212
00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:26.063
Oh, here we gan.

213
00:13:26.182 --> 00:13:28.687
I hear this all the time on the phone,
"I'm digital by default."

214
00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.597
Well I'm pencil by default.

215
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.479
Look, I mean, what happens
if you just cannae do it?

216
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.942
There's a special number
if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.

217
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:40.654
Right, well can you give us that?
Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.

218
00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.779
You'll find it online, sir.
I must ask you to leave now,

219
00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:46.486
if you've got no appointment.

220
00:13:50.206 --> 00:13:52.246
Right, can I help you?

221
00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.504
Yeah, I'm here to see about
changing my work coach.

222
00:13:56.587 --> 00:13:58.957
Thomas Armstrong, please.

223
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.801
Hang on a minute, Thomas, hang on.

224
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.300
Erm, would you like to take a seat?

225
00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:08.889
Oh, I just need a minute. I just felt...
I'm just feeling dizzy, you know.

226
00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.806
- Come and sit down.
- Oh, cheers, thanks.

227
00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:14.305
Could you move up, please, love?

228
00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:16.068
Thanks, pet, thank you.

229
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.610
- All right. I'll just get you a glass of water.
- Thank you.

230
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.700
Oh, thank you, pet. Thank you.

231
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:32.619
Are you all right? You look a bit pale.

232
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.831
It's just so bloody confusing,
all the jargon.

233
00:14:36.293 --> 00:14:39.423
I mean, there must be some mistake.
I'm just ganning round and round in circles.

234
00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:41.217
I've, I've really gotta
get this sorted out.

235
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.760
Oh I can understand that,
but you were late.

236
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:46.511
Thomas. You sit here
and drink your water, pet.

237
00:14:46.637 --> 00:14:47.847
Thank you.

238
00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:51.234
So now you're gonna sanction me so, er...

239
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.772
- No, I'm not gonna sanction you.
- I may not get any money for a month.

240
00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:56.312
I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker
and they'll make the decision

241
00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.318
- on whether they're gonna sanction you.
- That's ridiculous...

242
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.440
I'm not actually making the decision,
they're gonna do that.

243
00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:02.648
And then if they do decide
to sanction you,

244
00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:03.782
then you will take a 40%
cut in your benefits.

245
00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.912
I know what it is,
I don't need you to explain it to me.

246
00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.741
- I'm more than aware...
- Well there isn't anything else

247
00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:08.787
anybody can do today.

248
00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.367
So what I'm gonna have to do is,
look, I think I'm...

249
00:15:10.494 --> 00:15:12.164
I've decided to...
Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?

250
00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:13.328
I have to, I have to follow the rules.

251
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.915
And the thing is if you're gonna,
be aggressive with me

252
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.590
- then I'm gonna have to ask you...
- It's not about me being aggressive.

253
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.460
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I'm trying to explain to you a situation

254
00:15:20.588 --> 00:15:21.628
and you don't care.

255
00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.585
- Er, security. Security?
- I don't know why people like you do this job.

256
00:15:24.717 --> 00:15:25.804
I'm referring you to the decision maker.

257
00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:28.804
It's all the same thing.
I don't wanna hear your language

258
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.677
- I, I beg your pardon.
- Listen, I, I'm sorry, love,

259
00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:32.426
- but you're gonna have to leave.
- Yeah, all right, frankly,

260
00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:34.018
take your hands off me.
I'm gonna speak to the manager,

261
00:15:34.143 --> 00:15:36.693
- I don't wanna speak to you.
- The fact is I'm just trying to explain...

262
00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:37.900
- Sorry?
- I'm just explaining...

263
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.020
Well it's not you I wanna speak to...

264
00:15:39.148 --> 00:15:40.898
- You can go back up there.
- Right, come and talk to me then

265
00:15:40.983 --> 00:15:42.533
- if you've got something to say.
- Okay. Sorry.

266
00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:43.822
All right.

267
00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:46.452
I've tried to explain to the woman,
I've never been to Newcastle before.

268
00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:47.826
We've just moved up here from London.

269
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.946
I've been here a few days,
I don't know where I'm going. Okay?

270
00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.830
I was on the bus, it's gone the wrong way.

271
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.500
We've run, got off the bus,
run so that I wasn't any more late.

272
00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:58.212
She just don't wanna know and now she's telling
me she's gonna refer me for a sanction.

273
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.170
What I want you to do is listen to me. Okay?

274
00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:02.835
The lady's told you what's right.

275
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.381
There's rules here,
rules that we have to stick to. Okay?

276
00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.927
- It isn't against you, but you have a duty.
- Oh, mate, listen,

277
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.849
- I'm not saying it's against me.
- You have a duty to be here on time.

278
00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.390
And I'm explaining to you
why I wasn't here on time.

279
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.885
- D'you know what? I understand, right...
- I got lost.

280
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:18.186
But what I gather now
is the decision maker...

281
00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:20.812
The decision maker's gonna be
sending you a letter through the post.

282
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:21.860
So you're gonna have to wait for that.

283
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.940
- And then nobody...
- Yeah, I've got... My kids

284
00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:25.645
have gotta start school tomorrow.
I've got about 12 quid in my purse.

285
00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:27.858
- D'you know what?
- All because you can't just calm down

286
00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:28.867
- and listen to people when they talk.
- Right.

287
00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:29.987
- You have to do this.
- Right, d'you know what,

288
00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.195
- I've listened to you. You've created a scene.
- With your rules.

289
00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:33.406
- I think you need to...
- I've created a scene?

290
00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.615
- You need to leave the building.
- If I was gonna create a scene,

291
00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:36.746
you'd know about it, trust me.

292
00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:37.876
I'm sorry, love,
but you are gonna have to go.

293
00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:38.956
This is ridiculous.

294
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:40.421
- Jesus Christ!
- What am I supposed to do?

295
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.962
- Who's first in this queue?
- I am.

296
00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:44.669
D'you mind if this young lass signs on first?

297
00:16:44.797 --> 00:16:46.757
- No, no, you carry on.
- There you go.

298
00:16:46.882 --> 00:16:49.512
Now you can go back to your
desk and let her sign on

299
00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:51.885
and do the job that the taxpayer
pays you for.

300
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.470
- This is a bloody disgrace.
- Listen, all right,

301
00:16:54.598 --> 00:16:55.894
this doesn't have to involve you.

302
00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:59.234
Everybody's trying to do their job here
and you're creating more of a scene again.

303
00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:00.563
But, look, you're not listening to her.

304
00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:03.228
She's out of the area.
She's just been a few minutes...

305
00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:05.897
Can you not let her sign on?
She's got two kids with her, man.

306
00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:08.864
- What's wrong with you people?
- Right, listen, this isn't your concern.

307
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.357
I want you to get out as well. All right?

308
00:17:10.489 --> 00:17:12.779
I need you to leave.
We need to do this right. Yeah.

309
00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:14.368
- All right.
- Listen, listen, listen...

310
00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:15.993
- They're just gonna call the police.
- Phone the police.

311
00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:17.658
Can we get some perspective in here?

312
00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:19.538
You need to go or we're gonna
phone the police. All right?

313
00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:20.865
Come on. Thanks very much...

314
00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.539
Can we have a bit of perspective,
please, here, man?

315
00:17:22.668 --> 00:17:24.038
- Away, don't be silly.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

316
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.379
- Come on. Please.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

317
00:17:25.504 --> 00:17:27.134
- Come on, get out.
- All she needs is help, man.

318
00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:28.796
- Let's get going.
- Just let her sign on.

319
00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:30.264
Let's get going, all right.

320
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:31.682
Please.

321
00:17:31.927 --> 00:17:33.887
I don't know what's wrong
with you lot, I really don't.

322
00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.892
I need you to keep going for me, okay?

323
00:17:40.853 --> 00:17:44.023
- You want me to take one of them bags?
- No, it's all right, I'm fine, pet. I'm fine.

324
00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.025
- Where's Dylan?
- I don't know.

325
00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.614
Dylan! Come on!

326
00:17:51.697 --> 00:17:53.697
- Honestly. Honestly.
- He's a handful, isn't he?

327
00:17:53.824 --> 00:17:56.204
I can't sit down for five minutes
without him getting in trouble, can I?

328
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.446
Right.

329
00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:01.708
- Good, good choice.
- She loves spaghetti.

330
00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:03.292
Hey, you cannae go wrong
with spaghetti on toast.

331
00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.587
Spaghetti, spaghetti on toast, isn't it?

332
00:18:05.711 --> 00:18:06.961
Where's your brother gone?

333
00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.795
- Dylan!
- Dylan!

334
00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.512
Come on.

335
00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.592
This, this is what he does.
He runs, he runs off.

336
00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:14.048
- He's a handful, in't he?
- Come on!

337
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.723
Where ye been, on an adventure?

338
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.980
Dylan, not on the fences.

339
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.770
- It's just here.
- Mum, look, she's back, she's back.

340
00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:28.229
She's back.

341
00:18:34.907 --> 00:18:38.077
Tell you what, if it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna make this place a home.

342
00:18:39.328 --> 00:18:41.078
You don't know how to fix a cistern, do you?

343
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.751
It's driving me insane.

344
00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.326
- Yeah, I'll have a look at that.
- Yeah?

345
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.080
I can fix owt, me, pet,

346
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.091
apart from computers.

347
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.670
- Straight up. You show him...
- I'll show him.

348
00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:57.142
Dylan, can you stop it? Get in.

349
00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.816
Hello, Mum. How are you doing?

350
00:19:10.943 --> 00:19:11.993
Yeah.

351
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.320
Yeah, all right. All right. Yeah.

352
00:19:16.782 --> 00:19:19.122
It's nice, it's nice.
There's plenty of space.

353
00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:23.075
And, erm, yeah, it looks like they've put...
There's a nice bit of fresh carpet down.

354
00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.833
The, the walls are all
nicely painted and that.

355
00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:31.707
No, I know, Mum. Well, look, once...
Once you're feeling better and we're settled,

356
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:34.969
then you'll have to come up. You can come up
with Auntie May and stay, can't you?

357
00:19:36.218 --> 00:19:38.138
Yeah, they're nice, yeah, friendly.
Friendlier than London.

358
00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:41.308
Yeah.

359
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.430
D'you wanna have a word with Daisy?

360
00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.444
All right, hold on. Talk to Nana.

361
00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:51.069
Hello, Nan.

362
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.399
- Hello, Daisy. How are you?
- Good.

363
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:57.164
- Yeah? D'you like it?
- Yeah.

364
00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.366
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, very.

365
00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.408
I miss you, too. Bye.

366
00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.157
Bye-bye.

367
00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:07.174
Hello, Mum.

368
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:11.301
All right. That's all right.
All right, I'll speak... Yeah, I've gotta go

369
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.050
but I'll speak, I'll call you tomorrow.

370
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:14.843
- All right.
- All right, love you.

371
00:20:14.965 --> 00:20:17.545
- Love you, too. Bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.

372
00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.473
So what are you doing up here, Katie?

373
00:20:22.598 --> 00:20:24.558
It started when we got
kicked out of the flat.

374
00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:25.983
We got in a bit of trouble.

375
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.189
It was ridiculous.

376
00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:29.859
In Dylan's room there was a leak
coming through the wall,

377
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.650
coming through the top of the ceiling
down the wall.

378
00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:33.734
And it was making him really sick.
Weren't it, Dais?

379
00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:35.189
- Remember when Dylan weren't well?
- Yeah.

380
00:20:35.444 --> 00:20:37.574
We had to run all the way to the hospital.

381
00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.196
Yeah, he was in and out the hospital.

382
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:41.119
I was talking to the landlord about it,
spoke to him.

383
00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.199
And cos I complained, kicked us out.

384
00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.448
What, they can just do that?

385
00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:46.118
- Just throw you out?
- Yeah, yeah.

386
00:20:46.872 --> 00:20:49.002
So we got out of there.

387
00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:51.877
We was in a homeless hostel
for about two years, waiting on a flat.

388
00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:56.877
Yeah. But it was close to their school
which they loved, so...

389
00:20:57.591 --> 00:21:00.891
We just had to stick it out.
But we was in one room,

390
00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.140
the three of us were in one room.

391
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.270
Like eating, sleeping, all the rest of it
and Dylan was just climbing the walls.

392
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.100
Honestly,
like boxed in like that, so, yeah.

393
00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:13.768
They eventually offered me a flat,
so the good news was it was a flat.

394
00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:15.529
Bad news was it was up here.

395
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.861
And they couldn't give you
anywhere near your family?

396
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.157
No, not in London.

397
00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:23.237
They're, they're moving out the likes of me.
It's just too expensive for 'em.

398
00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:27.246
So how's the kids taking it?

399
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.250
They're brokenhearted about leaving school.

400
00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.827
Especially Daisy. She's furious with me.

401
00:21:33.502 --> 00:21:35.342
Having to leave her friends and her nan.

402
00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:38.922
I mean there was nothing I could do about it.
I couldn't have Dylan boxed in like that.

403
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:41.969
- Ah, she'll make friends soon enough.
- That's what I've told her.

404
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.641
And I've got a plan.

405
00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:47.603
We got a little garden now and they've
each got a room of their own.

406
00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.444
I'm gonna get a part-time job
and then I'm gonna go back to me books.

407
00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:53.306
- Oh, you at college?
- Open University.

408
00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:57.276
Yeah, I mucked up a little bit at school
so it's like a second chance.

409
00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.817
But that all fell apart a little bit when
we was at the hostel,

410
00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:02.105
but I'm not gonna give up.

411
00:22:02.656 --> 00:22:03.906
Can't, can I?

412
00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:05.529
Good on you, lass.

413
00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.203
It's bloody freezing in here.

414
00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:10.956
Oh, it must be a short.

415
00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:13.883
Right, where's your fuse box?

416
00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:16.593
There's nothing on the metre.

417
00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:20.757
The kids are starting school and
I wanted to get 'em some nice new clothes.

418
00:22:20.966 --> 00:22:22.756
And I thought I was gonna
get me money tomorrow.

419
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:25.509
Right.

420
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:29.471
I'll bring me tools round
and I'll sort this place out for you.

421
00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:31.888
- Will ya?
- Yeah, course I will.

422
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.770
Shouldn't take long.

423
00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:36.314
Right, thank you.

424
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.630
"Max Million", to my fucking address?

425
00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:48.258
- China, what's in this box?
- Dan, it's not what you think it is.

426
00:23:48.386 --> 00:23:49.756
Don't jump to conclusions.

427
00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:52.310
Shift that bloody rubbish
and shift your arse.

428
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.230
I wanna see what's in this box.

429
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.030
Oh my God. Wow.

430
00:24:09.074 --> 00:24:11.584
- What d'you think of these?
- Bloody trainers?

431
00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:13.328
- Trainers.
- Trainers.

432
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:15.333
- These are only the best, Dan.
- Very best.

433
00:24:15.413 --> 00:24:17.083
Aren't they, Piper?

434
00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:18.377
Aren't they?

435
00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:20.788
Stop it, man, I've got brittle bones.

436
00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:23.839
Anyways, I've got a test for you, Dan.

437
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:28.591
- Go on, open it.
- Open that.

438
00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:36.181
What's the difference?

439
00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:38.149
Yeah. What's the difference
between them two?

440
00:24:38.436 --> 00:24:39.596
They look the same.

441
00:24:39.938 --> 00:24:41.608
- Bang on, brother.
- Exactly.

442
00:24:41.731 --> 00:24:45.611
The difference is, they'd have cost me
150 quid on the high street...

443
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:47.651
And I'm gonna sell those for 80 quid.

444
00:24:48.488 --> 00:24:51.448
Cheap counterfeits to my fucking address?

445
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:54.541
I could have the Chinese Mafia
or the bloody Customs at me door.

446
00:24:54.828 --> 00:24:56.618
The brass neck of the bloody pair of you.

447
00:24:57.122 --> 00:24:59.622
Dan, these are not counterfeits.

448
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.040
They're from the same factory as these.

449
00:25:02.294 --> 00:25:05.464
Exactly the same quality.
Continuation of the same run.

450
00:25:05.964 --> 00:25:08.428
- D'you not believe us?
- It's fucking genius.

451
00:25:08.508 --> 00:25:09.548
How d'you manage this?

452
00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:12.386
Well I know a guy from Guangzhou, don't I,
who works in the factory.

453
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.060
Yeah, works in the factory.

454
00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:15.387
He's football mad.

455
00:25:15.473 --> 00:25:18.143
He knows everything
about the teams, the players, everything.

456
00:25:18.476 --> 00:25:21.056
So we do the deals by e-mails.
I send him the money by PayPal,

457
00:25:21.188 --> 00:25:23.358
then he sends me the package by post.

458
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:24.521
Me, you mean.

459
00:25:25.483 --> 00:25:29.153
Honestly, Dan, I did mean to say,
like I get them sent to different mates.

460
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:32.489
You know, small packages
like not to attract too much attention.

461
00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:34.124
They usually get through.

462
00:25:34.492 --> 00:25:36.492
I'll be able to tell all me mates
I knew both of you

463
00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:38.213
before you were arrested.

464
00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:40.792
See these trainers, Dan,

465
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:43.341
these are the future.

466
00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:45.922
No more crap jobs.

467
00:25:46.504 --> 00:25:48.304
No more shit from that warehouse.

468
00:25:48.423 --> 00:25:50.133
D'you know what the bastards
did this morning?

469
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:53.511
Got us in at 5:30.

470
00:25:53.762 --> 00:25:56.222
Unloaded one truck.
Guess how long that took?

471
00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:59.104
Forty-five minutes.
And you know how much I got paid?

472
00:25:59.517 --> 00:26:01.517
Three pound and seventy-nine pence.

473
00:26:01.728 --> 00:26:04.728
Waste of my fucking time.
It's worse than China.

474
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.530
I'm gonna make it big
one day, Dan. I'm serious.

475
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.900
Hi there, can I help you?
You look a bit lost.

476
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.020
Aye. I have to apply
for Jobseeker's Allowance...

477
00:26:46.147 --> 00:26:48.486
- Right, yeah. Mmm-hmm.
- And I wanna use one of them

478
00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:51.026
to get on to that Internet web thing.

479
00:26:51.152 --> 00:26:52.490
Right, you could do that today.

480
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.491
We're a bit busy at the moment.

481
00:26:53.571 --> 00:26:55.621
If you can come back a bit later,
would that be okay?

482
00:27:42.329 --> 00:27:44.709
- And then contact Job Centre Plus.
- Mmm-hmm.

483
00:27:45.248 --> 00:27:46.878
And, here we are. "Claim Jobseeker's".

484
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.710
- Okay? So double-click on that one.
- Okay. All right.

485
00:27:48.918 --> 00:27:52.128
And then we need to scroll
right the way down here to continue.

486
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.670
And that's your,
that's your form there for you.

487
00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:57.639
So you need to run the mouse up the screen,

488
00:27:57.719 --> 00:27:59.549
click into there and pop your postcode in.

489
00:27:59.637 --> 00:28:01.887
- Run the mouse up the screen, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

490
00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:05.639
- No. No, not quite like that.
- No?

491
00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:10.568
- What you need to do is get your cursor...
- "Your cursor"?

492
00:28:10.648 --> 00:28:13.228
It's a fucking apt name for it.

493
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:15.241
So when you're moving your mouse,

494
00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:17.533
- you see what I'm doing with my hand?
- Aye, right.

495
00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:20.155
- Look at my hand.
- Aye. Oh, right, it moves like that.

496
00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:22.580
- And then continue.
- Right, okay.

497
00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.660
- And then you start from there. Okay?
- Okay.

498
00:28:24.746 --> 00:28:26.956
- I'll leave you with it. Okay?
- Right.

499
00:28:30.668 --> 00:28:32.048
Right.

500
00:28:41.137 --> 00:28:43.717
Excuse me, pet.
You couldn't help us with this, could you?

501
00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:45.678
Yeah. What is it?

502
00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:48.647
I'm just filling this in.
I'm just... I cannot get the...

503
00:28:48.895 --> 00:28:50.605
This keeps darting all over the place.

504
00:28:50.688 --> 00:28:54.648
What do I do? Do I get on to that and...

505
00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:56.404
Do you just...
I mean, how do you get this down?

506
00:28:56.528 --> 00:29:00.028
Right, so you're controlling this,
and you click on this bar.

507
00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:01.619
- Right.
- And then you pull it down.

508
00:29:01.699 --> 00:29:02.949
- Oh, right.
- And then you get...

509
00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:05.576
- What, do I hold that on there, do I? Okay.
- The rest of it. Yeah.

510
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:06.793
- All right, then I can just...
- On the left side.

511
00:29:06.913 --> 00:29:08.583
What, what, so I hold this
and just pull that down?

512
00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:10.286
- Yeah, and click the left.
- And click...

513
00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:12.630
- Click to the left.
- Yeah. Right.

514
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.840
And I just put that in there?
Oh, that's right, thanks very much.

515
00:29:15.964 --> 00:29:17.514
- It's fine.
- Aye.

516
00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:20.973
You're a star. Right.

517
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.270
Right, have I done it right? There we are...

518
00:29:28.726 --> 00:29:30.726
Oh, bloody hell. What's this now?

519
00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:32.729
"Error"?

520
00:29:33.189 --> 00:29:34.729
Well, what have I...

521
00:29:37.735 --> 00:29:39.445
Here, mate, you divvent know
what I've done here, do you?

522
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:41.701
- This error thing.
- Yeah, that's a big thing.

523
00:29:41.781 --> 00:29:45.741
Do you? I don't know, I was just
filling in the thing and it just went...

524
00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:47.659
- There we go.
- Oh, oh, yeah, there we go.

525
00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:48.785
We're back on, right.

526
00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:50.173
- You're sorted, yeah?
- Hey, can you just hang on

527
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.170
just for two seconds so I divvent
go back here again. I'll...

528
00:29:53.751 --> 00:29:55.671
Just, just, just, I'll just like do
a couple more questions.

529
00:29:55.753 --> 00:29:57.343
Yeah, I'll just stand over here, don't worry.

530
00:29:57.547 --> 00:29:59.297
Er... "Are you a Br..."

531
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:02.511
- Yeah.
- "Yes". Right. I do that.

532
00:30:03.303 --> 00:30:04.803
- Right. What?
- Yeah.

533
00:30:04.929 --> 00:30:06.099
- What's...
- Then you should continue.

534
00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:07.522
Should be all right.

535
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.770
Right, okay.

536
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.688
What's...

537
00:30:10.768 --> 00:30:12.478
It's, it's, it's not bloody, it's not...

538
00:30:12.604 --> 00:30:14.234
- Well nowt's happening now.
- Yeah, just give it a second.

539
00:30:14.355 --> 00:30:15.725
Just give it a second.

540
00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:19.032
But it's just not mov... I mean, look,
it's not even, it's not even moving.

541
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:21.235
- Let me try, right.
- What? Here, get that.

542
00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:24.779
This is driving me mental, this.
I mean, what have I done now?

543
00:30:27.452 --> 00:30:29.452
- It's frozen. Yeah.
- It's frozen?

544
00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:31.409
Well... Well, can you defrost it?

545
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:33.039
No, mate, I can't.

546
00:30:34.417 --> 00:30:35.747
Think your time's up.

547
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.050
- What?
- Your time's up.

548
00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:40.471
- Me time's up?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, mate.

549
00:30:41.382 --> 00:30:43.802
Oh, sorry, mate, yeah.

550
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.010
- I'll just leave you to it.
- Oh jeez.

551
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:44.068
- Do you have a partner?
- Er, no. She, er, she's passed away.

552
00:31:44.487 --> 00:31:46.487
- Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

553
00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:50.954
D'you have any dependent children
aged under 20 living with you?

554
00:31:51.077 --> 00:31:52.117
No, I don't.

555
00:31:52.245 --> 00:31:56.325
It's really important we get this filled in
because we need to get the process started.

556
00:31:56.457 --> 00:31:57.877
Yeah.

557
00:32:01.087 --> 00:32:03.917
Excuse me, Ann. Can I have a word, please?

558
00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:06.379
Could you just give me 30 seconds, please?
We're just getting...

559
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:08.389
Well, actually,
can I have a word now, in my office?

560
00:32:08.511 --> 00:32:09.551
Thank you.

561
00:32:09.887 --> 00:32:12.717
- Right.
- Jesus, I've got you into trouble now.

562
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:15.600
- I'm really sorry.
- It's me that should be sorry.

563
00:32:15.727 --> 00:32:17.477
You just carry on, you're doing good.

564
00:32:19.147 --> 00:32:21.107
You know, Ann, we've spoke
about this before.

565
00:32:21.232 --> 00:32:22.532
That isn't acceptable.

566
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.900
- I think in this case it's quite reasonable...
- Come on in the office.

567
00:32:25.028 --> 00:32:26.858
The thing is you're setting a precedent.

568
00:32:26.946 --> 00:32:28.156
It's not acceptable.

569
00:32:41.586 --> 00:32:43.666
Oh, bugger. Bugger, it's...

570
00:32:44.922 --> 00:32:46.092
Jesus...

571
00:32:46.966 --> 00:32:48.466
I don't believe this.

572
00:32:49.177 --> 00:32:51.007
No, I only want my share of the football.

573
00:32:51.137 --> 00:32:54.597
Right then, that's the only team you
need to know in the northeast, is Newcastle.

574
00:32:54.724 --> 00:32:55.934
What other teams do you know?

575
00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:58.856
- Er, Middle... Middle-borough.
- Middlesbrough, aye.

576
00:32:58.936 --> 00:32:59.896
- Middlesbrough. Yeah.
- Middlesbrough.

577
00:32:59.979 --> 00:33:03.019
You know, you divvent need to think
about them either. Aye?

578
00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:07.865
There you go.

579
00:33:07.945 --> 00:33:10.815
Er, we only have one Wagon Wheel left,
so I cut it into four.

580
00:33:10.948 --> 00:33:12.870
But you can have two pieces
considering you're the host.

581
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.370
Oh, there you go.
I'll put your tea down there.

582
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.160
- Oh, hang on.
- Barclay's Premier League.

583
00:33:18.623 --> 00:33:20.173
Here's the big question, Stan Li.

584
00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:21.958
Did you say "Stan Li"?

585
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.130
Yeah. Stan Li from Guangzhou.

586
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:25.959
Are you two winding me up?

587
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:27.380
No, that's not our style.

588
00:33:28.966 --> 00:33:30.336
Can you hear me, Stan Li?

589
00:33:30.718 --> 00:33:32.098
Favourite player in the Premier?

590
00:33:33.721 --> 00:33:35.431
Charlie Adams, Stoke City.

591
00:33:35.556 --> 00:33:37.516
Get the fuck out of here.

592
00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:39.977
Are, are you taking the piss?

593
00:33:41.187 --> 00:33:43.937
EPL is crazy money, man.

594
00:33:44.023 --> 00:33:47.193
Charlie Adam. Four million.

595
00:33:47.568 --> 00:33:48.778
No ego.

596
00:33:48.986 --> 00:33:50.026
Team player.

597
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:52.031
Tough guy.

598
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:57.579
You see his goal against Chelsea
from his own half?

599
00:33:58.371 --> 00:33:59.581
Boom!

600
00:33:59.831 --> 00:34:04.421
The ball flies up, over Courtois' head.
Cross the line, line. Goal!

601
00:34:06.003 --> 00:34:09.633
He's not in China.
He's in the bloody takeaway down the road.

602
00:34:09.841 --> 00:34:12.761
You two, you're taking the piss.

603
00:34:13.594 --> 00:34:18.024
Okay, Stan Li,
I'll e-mail you my best price. Top price.

604
00:34:18.391 --> 00:34:21.021
I'm gonna see how I get on selling
these ones I've got, okay?

605
00:34:21.144 --> 00:34:22.484
So I'll let you know.

606
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.980
Best price, no bullshit.

607
00:34:25.148 --> 00:34:28.858
Remember, Charlie Charlie, all good money.

608
00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:32.025
Okay, no best price, no more trainer.

609
00:34:32.196 --> 00:34:33.606
No more business.

610
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.160
No more talkie-talkie. No more...

611
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:40.749
# Swing low, sweet chariot

612
00:34:40.872 --> 00:34:44.632
# Coming for to carry me home #

613
00:34:54.177 --> 00:34:56.887
Right, Dan.
Check your National Insurance Number.

614
00:34:58.055 --> 00:34:59.425
Yep, that's okay.

615
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.430
Press that button right there, Bill Gates.

616
00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:03.604
- What, this one here?
- That one there, "Send."

617
00:35:06.022 --> 00:35:10.072
Huh. It's taken me bloody days
to get this sorted out.

618
00:35:11.068 --> 00:35:12.398
Well done, son.

619
00:35:15.865 --> 00:35:17.905
Jobseeker's Application done.

620
00:35:18.743 --> 00:35:22.043
Dan, don't know why you're applying
for that after your heart attack.

621
00:35:23.456 --> 00:35:27.706
Right, now I'm printing your appeal form
for Employment and Support Allowance.

622
00:35:28.085 --> 00:35:32.465
But you can't appeal till they carry out
a mandatory reconsideration.

623
00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:35.511
Is that printing out now?

624
00:35:36.302 --> 00:35:39.642
You mean, they could have
given it to me just like that?

625
00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:44.349
Dan, they'll fuck you around,
I'm warning you.

626
00:35:44.727 --> 00:35:46.557
Make it as miserable as possible.

627
00:35:46.854 --> 00:35:48.864
No accident. That's the plan.

628
00:35:48.981 --> 00:35:50.861
I know dozens who have just given up.

629
00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:54.565
Well they've picked the wrong one
if they think I'm gonna give up.

630
00:35:55.071 --> 00:35:57.111
I'm like a dog with a bone, me, son.

631
00:36:04.121 --> 00:36:06.043
I have a note on the screen, sir,

632
00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:08.173
that you're awaiting a call
from the decision maker.

633
00:36:08.334 --> 00:36:10.754
Jesus, 55 minutes to hear all this again.

634
00:36:11.128 --> 00:36:12.258
Am I in a time warp?

635
00:36:12.588 --> 00:36:14.048
You can't proceed to the appeal

636
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:16.011
or the mandatory reconsideration

637
00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:18.183
till you have the call
from the decision maker.

638
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:21.561
Well, can you ask him to phone us
now, because I've got no income.

639
00:36:21.722 --> 00:36:25.142
I've got no pension
and I've still got the bedroom tax.

640
00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.600
I'll make a note on my screen, sir.

641
00:36:28.145 --> 00:36:29.475
Well can you not give him the note now?

642
00:36:29.605 --> 00:36:31.145
You know, put it in his hand?

643
00:36:31.691 --> 00:36:33.151
This is a call centre, sir.

644
00:37:00.595 --> 00:37:02.845
Hey, Dylan. D'you want a shot
at the screwdriver?

645
00:37:09.812 --> 00:37:14.192
What kills more people,
coconuts or sharks?

646
00:37:27.997 --> 00:37:30.077
He likes bouncing that ball, doesn't he?

647
00:37:30.207 --> 00:37:31.128
Pardon?

648
00:37:31.208 --> 00:37:33.878
That ball.
He likes bouncing it, doesn't he?

649
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:38.221
Well, it started in the hostel
where we had only one small room.

650
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.180
Why d'you think he does that?

651
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.060
I think he's missing his friends.

652
00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:47.219
But he also does it when he's angry.

653
00:37:47.433 --> 00:37:50.563
People never listen to him,
so why should he listen to them?

654
00:38:01.238 --> 00:38:05.278
There you go. And we don't need
any glue, nothing like that.

655
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.080
Now you give me a hand
and we'll stick this up.

656
00:38:12.416 --> 00:38:14.996
Right, you go that end and I'll go this end.

657
00:38:16.003 --> 00:38:17.303
And we'll stick this up here.

658
00:38:17.713 --> 00:38:19.383
Yeah? Just pass it up here.

659
00:38:20.216 --> 00:38:23.086
Aye, right. You do the bottom edge.
That's it.

660
00:38:24.261 --> 00:38:28.811
The sun heats up all
the air in these bubbles...

661
00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:32.266
And it'll keep your room nice and warm.

662
00:38:36.232 --> 00:38:38.942
Can you go into my tool bag there,

663
00:38:39.443 --> 00:38:41.283
there's a piece of cloth.

664
00:38:41.904 --> 00:38:43.284
Can you open it?

665
00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:50.536
Eh?

666
00:38:55.334 --> 00:38:57.294
- What do you think of that?
- It's gorgeous.

667
00:38:58.754 --> 00:39:02.594
Well it's a little present for
your new room.

668
00:39:02.717 --> 00:39:04.297
- Now...
- Thank you.

669
00:39:04.719 --> 00:39:07.219
- Where shall we put it?
- Up there, maybe.

670
00:39:07.304 --> 00:39:09.144
Okay, hang on.

671
00:39:10.141 --> 00:39:11.731
I'll get a hook and hang it there.

672
00:39:12.435 --> 00:39:13.765
Yeah, what do you think?

673
00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:15.441
It's great.

674
00:39:15.563 --> 00:39:17.313
It'll look like you're under the sea.

675
00:39:17.565 --> 00:39:20.525
And the sun will shine on them.

676
00:39:21.318 --> 00:39:22.988
I think there will be fine, yeah?

677
00:39:25.865 --> 00:39:27.315
I'll light these candles.

678
00:39:29.326 --> 00:39:30.576
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

679
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:32.249
- Now hang on.
- That one's big.

680
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:34.919
It is. Now there's four candles. Right?

681
00:39:35.332 --> 00:39:36.332
Mind you don't burn yourself.

682
00:39:36.459 --> 00:39:38.959
I won't burn meself,
don't worry about that.

683
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.960
But thank you for thinking about us, Daisy.

684
00:39:42.715 --> 00:39:44.295
Put that in there like that.

685
00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:48.007
And I put this one in here.
Now there's four candles in there, right.

686
00:39:48.345 --> 00:39:49.755
And they last for four hours.

687
00:39:51.348 --> 00:39:53.728
I'll put this small pot over. Right?

688
00:39:54.477 --> 00:39:56.147
Block the hole off up there.

689
00:39:57.188 --> 00:40:00.358
And then I put this big pot over the top.

690
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:05.282
Now it takes a little while
but it'll take the chill off the room.

691
00:40:05.362 --> 00:40:09.328
And if you just put your hand
over there now, you'll feel it, Daisy.

692
00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:12.158
If you just put your hand over there,
you'll feel it starting to warm up.

693
00:40:13.412 --> 00:40:15.832
- Huh, can you feel it? Yeah?
- A little bit.

694
00:40:15.956 --> 00:40:18.536
- What about you?
- Yeah, a little bit.

695
00:40:19.752 --> 00:40:21.502
Were you a soldier, Dan?

696
00:40:21.837 --> 00:40:23.207
Was I a soldier?

697
00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:25.719
Oh, more dangerous than that.
I was a carpenter.

698
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:27.381
Right, grub's ready.

699
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.930
- Yay!
- Go round that way then, Dylan.

700
00:40:29.053 --> 00:40:31.063
Good boy. There's yours, poppet.

701
00:40:33.182 --> 00:40:34.432
Right, put Sweet on there.

702
00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:36.639
Sit down nicely then.

703
00:40:41.607 --> 00:40:43.857
- And, Dan, this one's yours.
- Oh, no, not for me, thanks, no.

704
00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:45.404
That's yours. All right?

705
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.030
Here you are. All right?

706
00:40:48.364 --> 00:40:50.324
- Well, where's yours?
- I had mine earlier.

707
00:40:50.407 --> 00:40:51.777
I'm just gonna have a bit of fruit.

708
00:40:52.409 --> 00:40:54.499
You said that yesterday,
and the day before.

709
00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.160
All right, eat up then.

710
00:40:56.413 --> 00:41:00.293
Looks delicious but, you know,
it's a wee... It's a wee bit early for me.

711
00:41:01.794 --> 00:41:03.844
Please, Dan. It's the least I can do.

712
00:41:05.422 --> 00:41:07.222
- Thank you, Katie.
- All right.

713
00:42:06.817 --> 00:42:08.237
What was that sound, Mum?

714
00:42:08.485 --> 00:42:10.985
Oh, babe, one of the tiles just fell off
the wall in the bathroom

715
00:42:11.113 --> 00:42:12.323
where I was cleaning it.

716
00:42:12.448 --> 00:42:13.410
It's the middle of the night.

717
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.700
- I know.
- You should really get to bed.

718
00:42:14.825 --> 00:42:15.985
Okay. I'm gonna go to bed.

719
00:42:16.118 --> 00:42:17.158
I'm gonna go to bed.

720
00:42:17.286 --> 00:42:18.906
I just wanted to
get all the cleaning done in there

721
00:42:19.038 --> 00:42:20.498
so you can have a nice bath tomorrow.

722
00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:22.498
You like a bath, don't ya?

723
00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:23.915
Yeah?

724
00:42:24.335 --> 00:42:26.625
So you're gonna go up
and get into bed and wrap up nicely.

725
00:42:27.504 --> 00:42:29.514
Okay, good girl. Give me a kiss.

726
00:42:32.843 --> 00:42:34.553
Go and get into bed.

727
00:42:35.304 --> 00:42:37.514
- All right? Good girl.
- Promise me you'll get to bed.

728
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.520
I promise you I'm gonna go to bed.

729
00:42:40.517 --> 00:42:41.977
- Good night.
- 'Night, baby.

730
00:43:45.708 --> 00:43:47.458
Daniel Blake?

731
00:43:49.586 --> 00:43:51.456
If you'd like to follow me, Mr Blake.

732
00:43:57.177 --> 00:43:58.717
If you'd like to just take a seat.

733
00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:11.728
This is the Claimant Commitment form.

734
00:44:11.859 --> 00:44:15.609
You must commit yourself to spending
35 hours a week looking for work.

735
00:44:15.821 --> 00:44:19.071
Now that can be newspapers, agencies,

736
00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:22.616
and online via the Universal Job Match.

737
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:25.619
You just fill in the details.

738
00:44:25.998 --> 00:44:28.878
But you must prove that
you've done this as well, mind.

739
00:44:29.626 --> 00:44:32.956
Well I've been told by my doctor
that I'm not supposed to go back to work yet.

740
00:44:33.088 --> 00:44:36.218
Then you should apply
for Employment and Support Allowance.

741
00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:39.643
I have, but I've been knocked
back by some quack

742
00:44:39.762 --> 00:44:41.432
and now I'm trying to appeal.

743
00:44:41.805 --> 00:44:44.595
Okay. Well that's your choice, Mr Blake.

744
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.890
No, it's not my choice.

745
00:44:47.603 --> 00:44:49.193
I've got no other form of income.

746
00:44:50.022 --> 00:44:52.782
Do you want to sign this or not?

747
00:44:55.235 --> 00:44:58.985
You just need to put your
signature here. I shall date it later on.

748
00:45:05.871 --> 00:45:07.211
Thank you.

749
00:45:07.915 --> 00:45:09.915
Now can I have a look at your CV?

750
00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:11.667
"CV"?

751
00:45:12.669 --> 00:45:15.299
You still don't get this, do you, Mr Blake?

752
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.640
This is an agreement between
you and the State.

753
00:45:21.428 --> 00:45:22.599
No, you still don't get it.

754
00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:25.602
- No, you must...
- I'm desperate to go back to work.

755
00:45:25.682 --> 00:45:28.812
- If you're desperate to get back to work...
- Unless the doctor tells us...

756
00:45:28.936 --> 00:45:30.896
You need to have an up-to-date CV,

757
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:33.231
in order to help you look for work.

758
00:45:33.524 --> 00:45:35.114
Now, just hold it right there.

759
00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:39.662
There's a CV workshop
that I would like you to attend

760
00:45:40.739 --> 00:45:43.699
and it's this Saturday at 9:00.

761
00:45:44.576 --> 00:45:46.286
No, thanks, I'll sort that out on me own.

762
00:45:46.578 --> 00:45:51.168
No, Mr Blake. This is a formal direction.

763
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:56.710
You will attend if you want to proceed
with your Jobseeker's Allowance claim.

764
00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:58.632
What happens if I don't?

765
00:45:58.715 --> 00:46:01.715
Then you will be referred for a sanction.

766
00:46:07.683 --> 00:46:08.773
Ten seconds.

767
00:46:09.726 --> 00:46:11.346
Ten short seconds.

768
00:46:12.729 --> 00:46:16.939
That's how much a typical employer
spends flipping through a CV.

769
00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:18.399
Fact.

770
00:46:19.486 --> 00:46:22.156
Sixty applications for every low-skilled job.

771
00:46:22.281 --> 00:46:23.281
Fact.

772
00:46:23.407 --> 00:46:26.737
For a skilled job, it's twenty to one.

773
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:27.950
Fact.

774
00:46:28.745 --> 00:46:31.785
Costa Coffee advertised eight jobs.

775
00:46:32.583 --> 00:46:35.293
D'you know how many applications
they got from that?

776
00:46:36.086 --> 00:46:37.796
Over 1,300.

777
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.420
Fact.

778
00:46:40.215 --> 00:46:42.795
So, what does that mean?

779
00:46:43.552 --> 00:46:45.432
We should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee.

780
00:46:45.762 --> 00:46:47.352
Yeah, d'you wanna share that with us?

781
00:46:47.764 --> 00:46:50.064
I said, we should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee then.

782
00:46:50.184 --> 00:46:51.854
This is serious business

783
00:46:51.977 --> 00:46:54.347
and people have only got
one shot at this, all right?

784
00:46:54.646 --> 00:46:57.726
Well if you can count, it's obvious.
There's not enough jobs. Fact.

785
00:46:57.816 --> 00:47:00.566
Yeah, well, you'll be at
the back of the queue, won't you?

786
00:47:02.029 --> 00:47:03.909
For those of us in the real world,

787
00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:07.331
what that means is...

788
00:47:12.456 --> 00:47:16.456
"You must stand

789
00:47:17.127 --> 00:47:21.257
"out from the crowd."

790
00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:26.969
Get noticed. Get smart.

791
00:47:28.013 --> 00:47:30.683
It's not enough these days just to, er,

792
00:47:31.058 --> 00:47:32.808
just to show you have the skills.

793
00:47:33.018 --> 00:47:35.018
You have to prove

794
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.070
how keen you are. How dedicated.

795
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:40.781
Okay...

796
00:47:41.401 --> 00:47:45.031
What I'd like you to do now
is to, er, format your CVs.

797
00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:49.945
And, remember, all of these
have to be typed up in a clear font

798
00:47:50.786 --> 00:47:51.866
in hard copy.

799
00:47:52.246 --> 00:47:55.706
And we're also gonna need
a digital version for online.

800
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:57.830
And some companies,

801
00:47:58.835 --> 00:48:03.215
they're demanding CV videos,
sent in by smartphone.

802
00:48:03.674 --> 00:48:04.844
How about that?

803
00:48:05.717 --> 00:48:08.007
Okay? Let's make a start.

804
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.870
Are you taking any blokes on, mate?

805
00:48:37.332 --> 00:48:39.792
I'm a joiner, you know
I'm just looking for some work, you know.

806
00:48:39.876 --> 00:48:42.706
Not at the minute. Er, all manned up.

807
00:48:43.755 --> 00:48:46.465
Okay, can, can I give you my CV?
And then if you can get in touch...

808
00:48:54.308 --> 00:48:55.428
- Excuse me, mate.
- Yeah.

809
00:48:55.559 --> 00:48:57.889
D'you know if anybody's
taking anybody on round here?

810
00:48:58.353 --> 00:49:00.363
Er, no, we're not taking anyone on.

811
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.900
Er, I'll tell you what you could do.

812
00:49:03.358 --> 00:49:05.898
If you try about three units
up on the left there,

813
00:49:06.153 --> 00:49:07.903
they'll probably...
They, they might be havin' one.

814
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.740
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay? Cheers, mate.

815
00:49:11.908 --> 00:49:13.948
- Your best bet is to see him.
- Is he the boss? Him?

816
00:49:14.077 --> 00:49:15.832
He's, he's the supervisor.
That's the boss there.

817
00:49:20.042 --> 00:49:23.922
Excuse me, mate. D'you know if
they're taking anybody on here?

818
00:49:24.129 --> 00:49:25.919
Have you got any jobs ganning?

819
00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:28.048
No, you haven't?

820
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:31.553
Hey, mate, I'm looking for some work.

821
00:49:31.803 --> 00:49:34.723
- Is there anything ganning on around here?
- There's nowt here, mate. There's...

822
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:36.851
There might be something,
erm, a bit further up,

823
00:49:36.933 --> 00:49:38.943
- if you try one of the other estates, but...
- Yeah?

824
00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:40.941
...nothing doing on here.

825
00:49:55.118 --> 00:49:56.158
Help you, mate?

826
00:49:56.787 --> 00:49:57.907
Aye, I was just looking for some work, mate.

827
00:49:57.996 --> 00:49:59.916
I was wondering if you had
anything ganning on?

828
00:50:00.332 --> 00:50:01.582
I might have.

829
00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:02.708
- Aye?
- Done this graft before?

830
00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:05.714
- You got any experience?
- Oh, I've got 40 years of experience, mate.

831
00:50:05.837 --> 00:50:07.627
I can turn me hand to owt.
Can I give you me CV?

832
00:50:07.756 --> 00:50:09.416
Way-ay, course, I'll have a look at it.

833
00:50:12.177 --> 00:50:13.217
There you go.

834
00:50:14.721 --> 00:50:15.971
Cheers.

835
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.930
- Daniel?
- Aye, that's me.

836
00:50:18.016 --> 00:50:19.516
I'm Harry, by the way.

837
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.270
Well, you've got plenty
of experience, like, I've gotta be honest,

838
00:50:24.398 --> 00:50:25.902
I'm absolutely sick of young'uns.

839
00:50:25.982 --> 00:50:28.612
Half the time they divvent turn up.
When they do, they cannot be arsed.

840
00:50:38.745 --> 00:50:40.865
Dylan, Dylan, come off the road, come on.

841
00:50:41.415 --> 00:50:42.455
Come on.

842
00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:47.835
Dylan, come on. Catch up. Come on.

843
00:51:00.016 --> 00:51:02.686
- Is this the, er, queue for the food bank?
- It is, aye.

844
00:51:03.019 --> 00:51:03.940
D'you know how long we'll be waiting?

845
00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.020
Oh, a canny long time, I reckon.
We've been here ages already.

846
00:51:07.482 --> 00:51:08.732
Okay, thanks. Cheers.

847
00:51:45.395 --> 00:51:47.225
- Hello.
- Hello.

848
00:51:48.064 --> 00:51:49.444
How nice to see you.

849
00:51:49.816 --> 00:51:51.606
Have you brought your little dog today?

850
00:51:52.027 --> 00:51:53.697
Thank you very much, thank you.

851
00:51:57.449 --> 00:52:00.997
Is it just food for yourself
and the two children, Katie? Thank you.

852
00:52:01.077 --> 00:52:03.617
Would your children have
a drink of juice and a biscuit?

853
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.790
Would you like to go and see Agnes?

854
00:52:05.916 --> 00:52:09.126
Agnes?
Could you do a juice and a biscuit, please?

855
00:52:11.338 --> 00:52:13.048
- Jackie?
- Yeah.

856
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:15.841
Would you be able to
help Katie with her shopping today, please?

857
00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:17.297
- There you are.
- Thank you.

858
00:52:17.427 --> 00:52:20.307
Hiya, Katie. Thank you.

859
00:52:21.473 --> 00:52:25.103
So, we've got one adult and two
children, yeah? Come with me.

860
00:52:25.352 --> 00:52:27.942
- We'll start with the vegetables, yeah?
- Okay.

861
00:52:30.106 --> 00:52:31.476
Right.

862
00:52:31.775 --> 00:52:34.565
I'll give you one side
and we'll share it, yeah?

863
00:52:36.112 --> 00:52:38.412
- Couple of onions.
- Is there anything we can do for you, hun?

864
00:52:38.532 --> 00:52:40.122
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- Are you sure?

865
00:52:40.325 --> 00:52:42.115
- Aye, all right then.
- Toiletries, yeah?

866
00:52:43.578 --> 00:52:44.868
Okay...

867
00:52:45.163 --> 00:52:47.373
Have you just moved up here?
Your accent's not from here.

868
00:52:47.499 --> 00:52:49.959
- You're not a Geordie girl.
- Yeah. Yeah, been up a little while.

869
00:52:50.085 --> 00:52:51.165
Just come up from London.

870
00:52:51.294 --> 00:52:53.134
Right. Nice accent.

871
00:52:53.296 --> 00:52:55.051
Can you understand the Geordies?

872
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:56.301
Almost.

873
00:52:57.133 --> 00:52:58.223
Right, over here.

874
00:52:58.343 --> 00:53:00.683
I think we need another bag.
Have we got one?

875
00:53:01.137 --> 00:53:02.597
Did you bus here?

876
00:53:03.139 --> 00:53:05.809
- No? Well, sometimes.
- Well, sometimes.

877
00:53:06.142 --> 00:53:07.732
She likes tea sometimes.

878
00:53:08.144 --> 00:53:10.066
- Well, I'll just keep going in with stuff.
- Yeah.

879
00:53:10.146 --> 00:53:11.856
And then you tell me
what you don't need, yeah?

880
00:53:11.982 --> 00:53:13.232
Have you got any sanitary towels?

881
00:53:13.358 --> 00:53:16.398
- We don't have sanitary towels, no.
- No? All right, not to worry. It's all right.

882
00:53:16.528 --> 00:53:18.068
- Don't really donate things much like that.
- Yeah.

883
00:53:18.154 --> 00:53:19.614
It's a shame, they should.

884
00:53:20.323 --> 00:53:23.163
Right, right, if you open your bag. Rice?

885
00:53:32.919 --> 00:53:35.009
- And a couple of toilet rolls?
- Mmm-hmm.

886
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.170
Yeah?

887
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.130
We'll go to the food.
It's falling out me bag.

888
00:53:39.217 --> 00:53:41.717
- You can put...
- I've got this one. Right.

889
00:53:42.429 --> 00:53:45.929
Erm, tins in yours. Put them in there.

890
00:53:48.184 --> 00:53:50.314
Can you see anything else you want?

891
00:53:51.146 --> 00:53:52.436
- There you go.
- Okay, thank you.

892
00:53:52.564 --> 00:53:55.074
- Erm, there's pasta sauce over here.
- Mmm-hmm.

893
00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:56.991
I'll get you some pasta sauce?

894
00:53:57.986 --> 00:53:59.316
The pasta sauce...

895
00:54:02.407 --> 00:54:05.867
And there's, er, pasta here as well.
I'll get you a pasta.

896
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.210
Hey, pet, are you all right?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

897
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:20.091
Come and sit down. It's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.

898
00:54:20.258 --> 00:54:22.338
Come and sit down.
Come and sit down, it's all right.

899
00:54:22.802 --> 00:54:24.222
Oh...

900
00:54:26.097 --> 00:54:30.137
Okay, it's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.

901
00:54:30.226 --> 00:54:31.556
It's all right. D'you want a drink?

902
00:54:31.895 --> 00:54:34.225
- D'you want a drink?
- I'm really sorry...

903
00:54:35.357 --> 00:54:37.227
- What's the matter?
- It's okay, don't worry.

904
00:54:37.359 --> 00:54:39.649
- I'll get you a drink.
- Mum, what's going on?

905
00:54:39.778 --> 00:54:41.608
It's okay. It's okay

906
00:54:42.906 --> 00:54:45.366
I'm just really hungry.

907
00:54:45.825 --> 00:54:50.245
- Okay, don't look at me.
- No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

908
00:54:52.123 --> 00:54:53.423
There's no harm done.

909
00:54:56.878 --> 00:54:59.588
I can't cope, Dan.
I feel like I'm going under.

910
00:55:00.048 --> 00:55:01.628
Look, you'll get through this, darling.

911
00:55:01.925 --> 00:55:03.255
- Thank you.
- You'll get through this.

912
00:55:04.135 --> 00:55:06.465
Katie, listen to me.
This isn't your fault.

913
00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.230
You've done amazing.

914
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.850
Dumped up here, on your own with two kids.

915
00:55:13.269 --> 00:55:14.899
You've done nothing to be ashamed of.

916
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.940
Come on, you're okay.

917
00:55:17.065 --> 00:55:18.395
Come on, wipe yourself.

918
00:55:20.276 --> 00:55:22.486
Come on... You're okay.

919
00:55:22.737 --> 00:55:26.237
- If my mum could see me...
- It's okay.

920
00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:29.947
Look, these people are here to help you.

921
00:55:30.286 --> 00:55:31.956
You know, you've done nothing
to be ashamed of.

922
00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.000
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, you're all right.

923
00:55:34.124 --> 00:55:35.714
- Can I get you anything else?
- I just felt really faint.

924
00:55:35.917 --> 00:55:38.214
D'you need some paper
tissues or baby wipes?

925
00:55:38.294 --> 00:55:40.304
- I'll get you some baby wipes.
- Thank you.

926
00:55:42.298 --> 00:55:44.178
I felt really faint.

927
00:55:44.634 --> 00:55:48.054
Katie, can I get you something to eat?
Would you like some soup or something?

928
00:55:48.179 --> 00:55:50.389
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
If you could get her some water.

929
00:55:50.515 --> 00:55:53.015
Sure, yeah, anything. Yeah.
You not want some food?

930
00:55:53.143 --> 00:55:55.231
- Yeah, please, get...
- Even something sugary.

931
00:55:55.311 --> 00:55:56.861
I'll get you a doughnut or something.

932
00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.190
Yeah, yeah?

933
00:56:08.158 --> 00:56:10.328
There's no middlemen.
Straight from the factory.

934
00:56:10.869 --> 00:56:11.999
Same quality as the shop.

935
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.250
- Same quality, exactly.
- Well, you're gonna have to do us a deal.

936
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:15.251
I couldn't pay 80 quid for this, though.

937
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:17.671
If you go to the shop, they're 150 pounds.

938
00:56:17.792 --> 00:56:19.632
- A hundred and fifty quid?
- I'm selling these for 80 pounds.

939
00:56:19.753 --> 00:56:21.843
- Only 80 quid.
- See, they've still got the stickers on.

940
00:56:21.963 --> 00:56:24.593
Why are they 80?

941
00:56:25.008 --> 00:56:27.638
The reason they're 80 is because
there's no middlemen, nothing.

942
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:30.761
- No middlemen, whatsoever.
- You and Piper, the top new businessmen.

943
00:56:30.889 --> 00:56:32.268
That's my driver, Dan.

944
00:56:32.348 --> 00:56:33.558
I'll give you a bloody driver.

945
00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:35.390
So no-one's worn them before?

946
00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:37.438
No-one's wore them. Nothing, look.
Check the quality yourself.

947
00:56:37.562 --> 00:56:39.152
I'd probably wear them for the gym.

948
00:56:39.481 --> 00:56:41.691
I couldn't say 80 quid, mate.
This is too expensive for 80 quid.

949
00:56:41.816 --> 00:56:44.486
- They're 150 pound in the shop.
- A hundred and fifty pound, yeah.

950
00:56:48.114 --> 00:56:50.584
- Oh, Dan. You all right, mate?
- Hello, Joe.

951
00:56:51.367 --> 00:56:53.577
- Aye, I'm all right, mate, aye.
- How are you doing?

952
00:56:53.953 --> 00:56:57.293
Erm, listen, we're ganning, erm...
We're away down the pub the night.

953
00:56:57.373 --> 00:56:59.333
There's a load of us ganning.
There's a band on, you know.

954
00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:02.298
We're gonna sink a few pints.
D'you fancy, fancy coming down?

955
00:57:02.378 --> 00:57:06.218
Aye, I'd murder a pint, mate, but I daresn't.
I've been telt to lay off the sauce, you know.

956
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:08.304
- Oh, really?
- But, listen, tell the lads I'll come down

957
00:57:08.384 --> 00:57:09.844
and pop into the sawmill, eh?

958
00:57:09.969 --> 00:57:11.389
Oh, aye, aye, aye.

959
00:57:11.596 --> 00:57:13.886
You know, if you fancy it anyway,
we're all going down.

960
00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:15.385
So we might see you later, mate.

961
00:57:15.725 --> 00:57:17.595
- Nice to see you, man.
- See you then. Ta-ta, see you.

962
00:57:28.238 --> 00:57:29.778
Message for Daniel Blake.

963
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:33.411
Mr Blake, this is a call
from the DWP decision maker.

964
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:35.700
You should soon receive a letter

965
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:38.209
which states that you have been
deemed fit for work

966
00:57:38.414 --> 00:57:41.294
and not entitled to Employment
and Support Allowance.

967
00:57:42.043 --> 00:57:43.633
If you need any further information,

968
00:57:44.087 --> 00:57:46.417
it's available online. Thank you.

969
00:57:49.676 --> 00:57:51.466
Fuck's sake.

970
00:58:13.783 --> 00:58:15.793
- Hello?
- Hi, is that Daniel?

971
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.290
Yes, it is. Hi.

972
00:58:17.412 --> 00:58:18.872
Hi, Daniel, it's Harry Edwards here.

973
00:58:18.997 --> 00:58:20.327
We spoke the other day
at the garden centre...

974
00:58:20.456 --> 00:58:22.166
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- ...when you came down and handed your CV.

975
00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:25.002
- How are you doing, mate? Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, thanks, yeah.

976
00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:27.761
Er, listen. I tell you what, mate,
I've been going through all the CVs

977
00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:29.551
I've had handed over
the last couple of weeks.

978
00:58:29.674 --> 00:58:31.304
And I really like the look of yours.

979
00:58:31.426 --> 00:58:33.256
Erm, you've got the experience
I'm looking for.

980
00:58:33.469 --> 00:58:36.679
I was wondering if you could possibly, er,
pop by tomorrow and that for an interview?

981
00:58:37.223 --> 00:58:40.143
Oh... I'm really sorry, er, Mr Edwards,

982
00:58:40.268 --> 00:58:43.478
but, you know, er, my doctor's told
us I cannae come back to work yet.

983
00:58:45.064 --> 00:58:46.484
So you're not actually
looking for work, then?

984
00:58:47.483 --> 00:58:49.363
Well, it's hard to explain, you know.

985
00:58:50.945 --> 00:58:52.775
So, well, what's the point
of handing in your CV

986
00:58:52.906 --> 00:58:54.486
if you're not looking for work?

987
00:58:54.949 --> 00:58:56.909
Well it's the only way
I can get me benefits, you know?

988
00:58:57.535 --> 00:59:01.115
"Benefits"? So you prefer to be on
benefits than do a day's graft?

989
00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:02.747
You know, I thought you were
a genuine bloke.

990
00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:05.003
You know, I've spent a lot of time
going through them all.

991
00:59:05.126 --> 00:59:06.706
I've... I was gonna put some graft your way.

992
00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:10.050
You've just wasted my time completely.
Why don't you just sod right off!

993
00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.550
Listen, that's not...

994
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:44.460
- That's your change and your receipt.
- Thank you.

995
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.500
- Thank you very much. Have a good day.
- Bye.

996
00:59:46.584 --> 00:59:48.044
- Bye.
- Thank you, bye.

997
00:59:48.169 --> 00:59:50.549
Excuse me, madam.
I think you've been shoplifting.

998
00:59:50.797 --> 00:59:53.677
Would you like to come with me to
the manager's office and we can sort it out?

999
00:59:53.967 --> 00:59:55.217
I haven't been shoplifting.

1000
00:59:55.385 --> 00:59:57.595
Okay, you have, and I've seen you.
So if you'd like to come with me...

1001
00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.180
No, I've got a receipt. I've got, I've just,

1002
00:59:59.305 --> 01:00:01.845
- the lady there's just served me.
- Okay, and if everything on your receipt

1003
01:00:01.975 --> 01:00:03.305
is all you've got on you,
then there's no problem.

1004
01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:05.481
If you'd just like to come this way
to the manager's office.

1005
01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:06.482
No, I'm not going to the manager's office.

1006
01:00:06.562 --> 01:00:08.772
You just stood there and watched
her serve me, I've got a receipt.

1007
01:00:08.898 --> 01:00:10.398
I can lock the door and call the police.

1008
01:00:10.525 --> 01:00:12.395
You're talking about locking the
door and calling the police.

1009
01:00:12.527 --> 01:00:14.027
Would you like to come with me
to the manager's office?

1010
01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:15.573
No, because I've just, you've
just watched me...

1011
01:00:16.114 --> 01:00:17.324
Okay, and we'll sort that out.

1012
01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:19.448
Okay, and if everything
on the receipt's in your bags,

1013
01:00:19.575 --> 01:00:21.195
- then there's no problem.
- You don't need to shout at me.

1014
01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:22.747
Okay, if you'd like to come this way.

1015
01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:25.708
She's just, you've just stood
there and watched it...

1016
01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:28.082
- Okay, then we'll sort it out.
- ...and serve me with, didn't you?

1017
01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:29.589
And she's given me a receipt.

1018
01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:30.844
Just this way.

1019
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.440
Ivan, I'll take it from here.

1020
01:00:52.984 --> 01:00:54.404
What's your name, love?

1021
01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:56.489
- Katie.
- Katie?

1022
01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:58.742
- Katie Morgan.
- Katie Morgan.

1023
01:00:59.157 --> 01:01:00.277
I'm really sorry.

1024
01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:03.076
I haven't done anything like this before.
I've paid for these.

1025
01:01:07.165 --> 01:01:08.745
What are you gonna do?

1026
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.250
Katie.

1027
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.470
It's between me and you...

1028
01:01:16.674 --> 01:01:18.974
It's got nowt to do with the store.
All right?

1029
01:01:20.636 --> 01:01:21.966
They're paid for.

1030
01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:27.854
Get yoursel' away.

1031
01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:33.858
Thank you.

1032
01:01:48.664 --> 01:01:50.628
Hey, hang on a second. Hey, hang on...

1033
01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.088
I'm sorry about that, I am.

1034
01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:54.999
Can I get a quiet word?

1035
01:01:56.130 --> 01:02:00.340
Look, if you're in trouble and you
need money, I can help, okay?

1036
01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:03.349
Look, a nice girl like you,
I can definitely help.

1037
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.100
That's my number. My name's Ivan, okay?

1038
01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:13.107
Ring me any time, all right?

1039
01:02:13.481 --> 01:02:14.521
Okay?

1040
01:02:35.962 --> 01:02:37.842
Come and have a look at this.

1041
01:02:40.716 --> 01:02:41.966
That is a miracle.

1042
01:02:42.093 --> 01:02:43.763
He's been sat there for about 15 minutes.

1043
01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.107
What's this, Dan?

1044
01:03:03.698 --> 01:03:04.738
It's a cassette.

1045
01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:06.119
What's a cassette?

1046
01:03:06.492 --> 01:03:08.122
Plays music. Come here, I'll show you.

1047
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:15.790
All right.

1048
01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:20.208
You pop that in there.
Oh, no, you gotta take it out the case first.

1049
01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:23.376
It'll not play like that.

1050
01:03:24.427 --> 01:03:26.177
Right, you put that in there like that. Yeah?

1051
01:03:27.597 --> 01:03:28.927
And press that button there.

1052
01:03:31.893 --> 01:03:33.523
Bit more. Harder.

1053
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.060
That's it.

1054
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:38.321
It was Molly's.

1055
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:40.990
She recorded it off the radio.

1056
01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:42.777
Shipping forecast.

1057
01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:44.784
It's on late at night.

1058
01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:48.488
Sailing By. D'you like that tune?

1059
01:03:48.618 --> 01:03:50.748
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Molly loved it.

1060
01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.173
It's nice, isn't it?

1061
01:04:11.224 --> 01:04:12.434
So how'd the interview go?

1062
01:04:12.808 --> 01:04:15.388
Oh, nothing's working out
with the school times at the minute.

1063
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:18.811
So I went to, erm, some of the agencies
and put my name down on the waiting list,

1064
01:04:19.232 --> 01:04:20.822
cos I could do cleaning in the morning.

1065
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:23.820
Went to some hotels.
Went round all the cafes.

1066
01:04:24.153 --> 01:04:25.573
Must have walked for bloody miles.

1067
01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:27.491
Well, I can pick the kids
up for you, you know.

1068
01:04:27.823 --> 01:04:29.033
Till I start work again.

1069
01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:38.206
Dan. The answer is "coconuts".

1070
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.960
Correct.

1071
01:04:41.504 --> 01:04:42.844
What's he talking about, "coconuts"?

1072
01:04:43.214 --> 01:04:45.054
Ah, shall we tell your mum?

1073
01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:50.428
- Go on.
- When I was bouncing my ball on the stairs.

1074
01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.766
- What stairs?
- The stairs in our house.

1075
01:04:52.848 --> 01:04:55.728
- Yeah.
- Dan asked me a question.

1076
01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:57.441
What, what question did he ask ya?

1077
01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.693
"What kills people more?

1078
01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.777
- "Coconuts or sharks?"
- Mmm-hmm.

1079
01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:03.187
And I said coconuts.

1080
01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:04.357
And you got it right?

1081
01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:05.855
- Is that right?
- Yeah, he's right.

1082
01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:12.699
Is that Molly?

1083
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.410
Yeah. Yeah, that's Molly, yeah.

1084
01:05:17.415 --> 01:05:18.865
Let's see that, Dais.

1085
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:20.880
Show me that one.

1086
01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:27.299
"Molly." Like the name.

1087
01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.640
What was she like?

1088
01:05:30.886 --> 01:05:31.926
She was special.

1089
01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:35.677
Yeah, she was special, Daisy.

1090
01:05:37.143 --> 01:05:38.523
Not easy.

1091
01:05:40.563 --> 01:05:42.273
She was up one minute, down the next.

1092
01:05:44.692 --> 01:05:46.902
Smart and funny. Huh.

1093
01:05:48.738 --> 01:05:50.908
Ah, that lass made me laugh.

1094
01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:54.078
Kind.

1095
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:57.040
She had a big, big heart.

1096
01:05:58.914 --> 01:05:59.924
But...

1097
01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:04.377
She said her head was like the ocean.

1098
01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:09.092
Dead still, then wild.

1099
01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:12.925
Never knew where she'd end up next.

1100
01:06:14.764 --> 01:06:16.354
I mean, the music helped that.

1101
01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:19.693
But then she'd hit the rocks.

1102
01:06:20.353 --> 01:06:22.363
"Where'll we sail to tonight, Dan?"

1103
01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:24.398
That was our little joke.

1104
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.190
Her last words to me were,

1105
01:06:29.904 --> 01:06:33.994
"I wanna sail away, Dan,
with the wind at me back.

1106
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:37.121
"That's all I need, Dan."

1107
01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:41.084
Do you have any children?

1108
01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:45.128
I'd have loved that, Daisy. No.

1109
01:06:46.504 --> 01:06:48.344
- Do you miss her?
- Dais.

1110
01:06:48.756 --> 01:06:50.086
It's okay.

1111
01:06:51.926 --> 01:06:52.966
She was crazy.

1112
01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:55.763
Hard work.

1113
01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:00.234
But I loved her to bits.

1114
01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:04.648
I'm lost without her, really.

1115
01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:10.404
- There you go, pet.
- Oh, thank you.

1116
01:07:11.445 --> 01:07:12.985
That must have been hard for you, Dan.

1117
01:07:13.239 --> 01:07:14.989
I mean, did you look after her
right till the end?

1118
01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:19.995
Well, you know, I thought it'd be
a relief when she passed away.

1119
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:24.039
Cos it was difficult to go into work,
you know, when she was ill.

1120
01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:28.166
And after you've been looking after
somebody for so long...

1121
01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:30.756
It seems to take over your life, you know.

1122
01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:32.973
- Yeah, and you forget your own.
- Huh.

1123
01:07:34.844 --> 01:07:36.394
Well she was lucky to have you.

1124
01:07:38.139 --> 01:07:41.769
Daisy's dad, I thought was
something really special.

1125
01:07:43.018 --> 01:07:44.228
He turned out not to be.

1126
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.980
Me mum tried to warn me about it,
but I was 18, so I didn't listen.

1127
01:07:49.024 --> 01:07:51.034
And then I did the same
thing with Dylan's dad.

1128
01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:54.611
You're a young lass,
you got your whole life ahead of you.

1129
01:07:55.573 --> 01:07:58.033
And when you get back
to those books, you'll be flying.

1130
01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:01.164
Yeah, I can't look at 'em, Dan.
They really upset me.

1131
01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:06.038
- You gotta keep a hold, you know.
- Mmm-hmm.

1132
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.287
You're doing your kids proud.

1133
01:08:12.173 --> 01:08:16.053
I mean, we all need the wind
at our back every now and then.

1134
01:08:16.469 --> 01:08:18.719
- Don't we?
- Mmm. Yeah.

1135
01:08:29.398 --> 01:08:31.108
Well that's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1136
01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:36.491
And how do I know you've actually
been in contact with all these employers?

1137
01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:40.698
Well, I walked round the town.
I gave out me CV by hand.

1138
01:08:41.619 --> 01:08:42.949
Well, prove it.

1139
01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:45.747
- How?
- Well, did you get a receipt?

1140
01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.500
Take a picture with your mobile?

1141
01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:50.094
With this?

1142
01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:52.586
I give you my word that's what I did.

1143
01:08:52.838 --> 01:08:54.418
That's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1144
01:08:55.257 --> 01:08:58.007
What about the Universal Job Match online?

1145
01:08:58.886 --> 01:09:02.096
I went to the library,
there's my appointment card.

1146
01:09:05.226 --> 01:09:08.396
Did my head in. And I tried my best.

1147
01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:11.108
It's not good enough.

1148
01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:13.817
Can I look at your CV?

1149
01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:15.243
All right.

1150
01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:29.117
Did you not learn anything
at the CV workshop?

1151
01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:30.956
You'd be surprised.

1152
01:09:33.128 --> 01:09:34.758
Not good enough, Sheila?

1153
01:09:37.132 --> 01:09:38.512
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refer you

1154
01:09:38.634 --> 01:09:42.144
to a decision maker for a possible
sanction for four weeks.

1155
01:09:43.347 --> 01:09:45.427
Your payment will be frozen.

1156
01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:48.691
You may be entitled
to Hardship Allowance if you apply.

1157
01:09:49.562 --> 01:09:50.982
Do you understand?

1158
01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:56.317
And if you are sanctioned, you must
continue to look for work and sign on.

1159
01:09:56.443 --> 01:09:59.363
If you don't, you may be sanctioned again.

1160
01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:04.155
And it's likely to be for thirteen weeks
on the second occasion, and thereafter.

1161
01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:08.751
And likely to be the maximum
of up to three years.

1162
01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:13.165
Would you like me to write
you a referral to a food bank?

1163
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.910
Dan, you're not leaving, are you?

1164
01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:49.623
Aye, I'm off to the Bahamas.

1165
01:10:50.956 --> 01:10:53.206
Nah, I'm just sick of the old stuff.
I need a change.

1166
01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:55.586
Are you okay, Dan?

1167
01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:58.012
I'm fine, son.

1168
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.010
You don't look okay.

1169
01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:01.629
No, really, I'm fine.

1170
01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:04.926
You haven't given us a row
about leaving the rubbish out.

1171
01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.351
I'm okay, China, really.

1172
01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:10.596
If you need anything, Dan, let me know.

1173
01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.230
Absolutely anything.

1174
01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:17.020
I mean it, Dan, anything.

1175
01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:18.821
I know, son.

1176
01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:23.527
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a hundred.

1177
01:11:23.656 --> 01:11:27.236
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, two hundred.

1178
01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.200
All right?

1179
01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:32.159
Aye, fair enough.

1180
01:11:32.748 --> 01:11:34.248
Anything else I can help you with?

1181
01:11:35.084 --> 01:11:36.174
No, that's it.

1182
01:11:43.759 --> 01:11:44.799
What about these?

1183
01:11:45.052 --> 01:11:46.262
Good quality hand tools.

1184
01:11:47.262 --> 01:11:50.272
Nae chance. I'll be ganning back
to work soon enough.

1185
01:11:50.683 --> 01:11:52.773
Well, the offer's there.

1186
01:11:54.645 --> 01:11:57.265
Now these look nice. How much d'you want?

1187
01:11:58.065 --> 01:11:59.265
They're not for sale, mate.

1188
01:12:00.275 --> 01:12:03.025
Give us a ring if you change
your mind. See you now.

1189
01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:43.322
What are you doing?

1190
01:12:45.612 --> 01:12:47.162
Oh, you're freezing.

1191
01:12:48.824 --> 01:12:49.874
What's wrong?

1192
01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:55.156
Well, erm, the girls at school
are making fun of me.

1193
01:12:56.248 --> 01:12:57.328
They're what?

1194
01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:59.666
The girls at school are making fun of me.

1195
01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:02.337
Why are they making fun of you?

1196
01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:05.088
My shoes fell apart.

1197
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.340
Oh, did they?

1198
01:13:08.135 --> 01:13:09.635
But we glued them back together.

1199
01:13:10.262 --> 01:13:11.642
- Mmm.
- They fell apart again?

1200
01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:16.983
All right, we can get you
a new pair of shoes.

1201
01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.729
We don't have the money.

1202
01:13:19.354 --> 01:13:21.774
Don't you worry about that,
we can get you a new pair of shoes.

1203
01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:24.315
Okay.

1204
01:13:25.319 --> 01:13:29.159
One of the girls heard about
what happened at the food bank.

1205
01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:32.871
And they're saying
things to you about that, are they?

1206
01:13:34.286 --> 01:13:35.656
We'll get it sorted, don't you worry.

1207
01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:39.462
D'you wanna sleep here with me?

1208
01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:43.375
Yeah? All right, babe,
roll over then. Tuck in.

1209
01:13:44.296 --> 01:13:47.666
That's it. Roll right over. I'll tuck you in.

1210
01:13:49.343 --> 01:13:50.473
Good girl.

1211
01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:17.535
Hello?

1212
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.210
Hello, is that Ivan?

1213
01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.420
It is, yeah. Who's that?

1214
01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:24.339
It's, it's Katie,
the girl at the supermarket.

1215
01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:26.419
You gave me... You gave me
your phone number.

1216
01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:28.633
Okay, I remember you.

1217
01:14:29.216 --> 01:14:32.756
Yeah, I was, erm... I was ringing about
the work that you were talking about.

1218
01:15:12.467 --> 01:15:13.887
It's nice to meet you.

1219
01:15:29.026 --> 01:15:31.406
You don't need to be nervous
with me. I can see you're in pain.

1220
01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:33.236
You don't... You don't need to be, all right?

1221
01:15:33.488 --> 01:15:35.488
I'm gonna help you. Okay?

1222
01:15:35.991 --> 01:15:37.411
So, don't cry, right.

1223
01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:39.492
I don't want you to cry, I'm gonna help you.

1224
01:15:39.578 --> 01:15:42.788
I know the situation. Ivan's told us a little
bit about you and, you know,

1225
01:15:42.915 --> 01:15:44.875
and that's what I'm here for.
I am gonna help you.

1226
01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:51.505
Hey, ya.

1227
01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:53.507
- All right?
- Yeah.

1228
01:15:54.134 --> 01:15:55.514
Did they, er, they go down all right?

1229
01:15:55.636 --> 01:15:58.506
Nae bother. Both fast asleep. How'd it go?

1230
01:15:59.139 --> 01:16:02.729
Yeah, it was good, it was good.
It was a, it was a single-parent meeting.

1231
01:16:03.518 --> 01:16:05.808
One of the mums came and spoke
to me afterwards, she was really nice.

1232
01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.442
Ah, there's some good people round, yeah.

1233
01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:08.522
Yeah.

1234
01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:12.395
Make sure you take care
of yourself, Dan, won't ya?

1235
01:16:12.527 --> 01:16:13.737
- Course I will.
- All right.

1236
01:16:13.904 --> 01:16:15.534
- See you soon.
- Good night.

1237
01:16:17.157 --> 01:16:19.527
- Give my love to the kids in the morning.
- I will do.

1238
01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.250
- Thank you.
- 'Night.

1239
01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:29.596
Dan, it's me. Erm, thank you
for coming round tonight.

1240
01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:34.194
Daisy woke up and she forgot to ask
you about her school project.

1241
01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:37.071
She's, erm, she's gotta interview
somebody about their work

1242
01:17:37.195 --> 01:17:38.605
and she wants to speak to you.

1243
01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:41.454
Oh, and they, they loved all your stories.

1244
01:17:42.034 --> 01:17:44.624
She said that Dylan was just
laughing and laughing.

1245
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.710
It was lovely. Nearly made me cry
when she told me.

1246
01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:54.627
All right, I'll speak to you soon.
Sleep well. 'Night.

1247
01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:42.966
I've come to see the girl.

1248
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:44.680
Okay. Come in.

1249
01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:53.765
Erm, do I pay you?

1250
01:18:54.106 --> 01:18:56.686
No, you pay the girl. It's that door there.

1251
01:18:57.692 --> 01:18:58.692
Right.

1252
01:19:09.413 --> 01:19:10.663
Oh, no, Dan.

1253
01:19:15.627 --> 01:19:17.087
Katie, you don't need to do this.

1254
01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:21.428
You shouldn't see me like this.

1255
01:19:23.051 --> 01:19:24.091
I'm sorry.

1256
01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:28.809
No, this, this is cut off. This is separate.
Can you... You need to get out.

1257
01:19:31.935 --> 01:19:34.725
Listen, I couldn't speak to you in the flat,
I need to speak to you now.

1258
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:36.820
Dan, please, get out.

1259
01:19:37.732 --> 01:19:39.652
Oh, Katie, please, I need to speak to you.

1260
01:19:42.863 --> 01:19:44.659
I just wanna speak to you. Katie!

1261
01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:46.739
Dan, please, just go.

1262
01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:53.123
Dan, please, I don't want you here!
Will you just go, please!

1263
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:57.749
- I've built you a bookcase.
- What?

1264
01:19:57.961 --> 01:19:59.051
For your books.

1265
01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:01.973
Oh, Dan. Please, just go.

1266
01:20:02.716 --> 01:20:04.966
- Please, just go, I don't want you here.
- This is breaking my heart.

1267
01:20:05.093 --> 01:20:07.143
Dan, please, just leave me alone.

1268
01:20:18.356 --> 01:20:20.106
I've got 300 quid in my pocket.

1269
01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:23.151
I can buy the kids fresh fruit.

1270
01:20:29.784 --> 01:20:31.794
If you can't deal with it,
I can't see you any more.

1271
01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:35.081
Listen, I've gotta go back inside.
D'you understand?

1272
01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:39.963
I don't wanna speak to you any more.

1273
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.300
And don't show me any more love.

1274
01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:48.141
Cos you're gonna break me, Dan.

1275
01:21:17.374 --> 01:21:18.424
I don't understand.

1276
01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:21.795
So what jobs have you actually applied for?

1277
01:21:23.755 --> 01:21:25.215
It's a monumental farce, isn't it?

1278
01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.850
You sitting there with your
friendly name tag on your chest, Ann,

1279
01:21:32.222 --> 01:21:36.022
opposite a sick man looking
for nonexistent jobs,

1280
01:21:36.476 --> 01:21:38.396
that I can't take anyway.

1281
01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.940
Wasting my time, employers' time, your time.

1282
01:21:44.401 --> 01:21:47.651
And all it does is humiliate me,
grind me down.

1283
01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:51.203
Or is that the point,
to get my name off those computers?

1284
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:54.371
Well, I'm not doing it any more.

1285
01:21:54.869 --> 01:21:56.039
I've had enough.

1286
01:21:57.872 --> 01:21:59.792
I want my date for my appointment

1287
01:21:59.874 --> 01:22:02.884
for my appeal for Employment and Support.

1288
01:22:03.003 --> 01:22:05.213
- Have you not had that yet?
- No.

1289
01:22:06.881 --> 01:22:08.261
Please listen to me, Dan.

1290
01:22:09.301 --> 01:22:14.851
It's a huge decision to come off JSA
without any other income coming in.

1291
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:18.891
Look, it... It could be weeks before
your appeal comes through.

1292
01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:23.517
You see, there's no time limit
for a mandatory reconsideration.

1293
01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:25.315
I've got a time limit.

1294
01:22:26.026 --> 01:22:27.896
And you might not win.

1295
01:22:29.863 --> 01:22:32.823
Please, just keep signing on.

1296
01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:35.953
Get somebody to help you
with the online job searches.

1297
01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:39.997
Otherwise, you could lose everything.

1298
01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:44.996
Please don't do this. I've seen it before.

1299
01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:49.720
Good people, honest people, on the street.

1300
01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.930
Thank you, Ann.

1301
01:22:54.512 --> 01:22:57.472
But when you lose your self-respect,
you're done for.

1302
01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:08.441
I'll be seeing you gentlemen later.

1303
01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:42.728
Oh, wait until security sees this.

1304
01:24:01.121 --> 01:24:04.211
What's going on here?
What are you fucking playing at?

1305
01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:06.956
- Aye-aye. You cannot touch us.
- Well that's clever, in't it?

1306
01:24:08.545 --> 01:24:09.995
It's me new art installation.

1307
01:24:23.309 --> 01:24:27.019
Eh? Certainly can, lads. Come on.

1308
01:24:28.732 --> 01:24:30.192
Look at this, you got all the technology.

1309
01:24:59.053 --> 01:25:01.563
- Look at this!
- I can't believe it.

1310
01:25:03.057 --> 01:25:05.807
I cannot believe it, man.
What have you done?

1311
01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:09.059
This is me new hobby.
Shall I put that on my CV?

1312
01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:11.976
Did you stop, even for a second,

1313
01:25:12.066 --> 01:25:14.566
to think about the consequences
of what you've done here?

1314
01:25:14.694 --> 01:25:18.114
All I know, mate,
is if I divvent get my appeal date,

1315
01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:21.079
I'll be here every day doing this.

1316
01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:23.829
- Unbelievable. Every day?
- Every day.

1317
01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:26.158
Tell you what, Ben,
just phone the police. Okay.

1318
01:25:26.581 --> 01:25:28.291
I cannae... Listen, mate,
I cannot believe this now.

1319
01:25:28.416 --> 01:25:30.746
This is out of our hands.
We're gonna have to phone the cops, man.

1320
01:25:30.877 --> 01:25:32.917
Well, if youse had done your job
like you should have done,

1321
01:25:33.046 --> 01:25:34.336
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.

1322
01:25:34.464 --> 01:25:36.384
I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it.

1323
01:25:38.593 --> 01:25:40.013
Go on, lad, give him a hand.

1324
01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:43.098
Yes!

1325
01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:45.233
Words of wisdom!

1326
01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:47.313
You're the man, wee man! Eh?

1327
01:25:47.685 --> 01:25:49.595
Fucking eh? Yeah!

1328
01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:53.566
Are youse out of work, mate?

1329
01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:55.321
Are you fucking... Are you Daniel Blake?

1330
01:25:55.443 --> 01:25:56.493
I am Daniel Blake, yes.

1331
01:25:56.611 --> 01:25:58.201
Hey, this is Daniel Blake!

1332
01:25:58.321 --> 01:26:00.781
Fucking look at that. Yeah!

1333
01:26:00.907 --> 01:26:02.407
Yeah! Hey!

1334
01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:08.161
You look fucking freezing, pal.
Here, have my jacket.

1335
01:26:08.289 --> 01:26:10.044
- No, no.
- No, come on, man, have my fucking jacket.

1336
01:26:10.124 --> 01:26:12.344
It's all right, son. Look after yoursel', eh?

1337
01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.750
Keep yoursel' warm like.

1338
01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:15.049
You're a gentleman.

1339
01:26:18.132 --> 01:26:19.972
So what's, what's your appeal all about?

1340
01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:25.056
Liar!

1341
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.561
You're... You're under arrest
on suspicion of criminal damage.

1342
01:26:29.686 --> 01:26:32.056
Hey, a miscarriage of justice, eh.

1343
01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:34.936
Slow down. Whoa. Back off.

1344
01:26:35.066 --> 01:26:36.070
All right, all right, all right.

1345
01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:37.860
What the fuck's going on? Eh?

1346
01:26:37.986 --> 01:26:41.156
You should be arresting the wankers
who came up with sanctions. Eh?

1347
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:44.330
That preachy baldy cunt. What's his name?

1348
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:46.950
Ian Duncan fucking what's-his-face.

1349
01:26:47.287 --> 01:26:48.867
Aye, and the posh dicks in their mansions

1350
01:26:48.997 --> 01:26:51.077
who came up with the fucking
bedroom tax for disabled...

1351
01:26:51.165 --> 01:26:54.995
Listen, youse are all gonna
be out of a fucking job anyway.

1352
01:26:55.128 --> 01:26:58.168
Privatizing you, eh?
All the fucking Tories, man.

1353
01:26:58.298 --> 01:27:01.095
Aye, members of the fucking big club, eh.

1354
01:27:01.175 --> 01:27:02.885
Fucking posh Eton twats.

1355
01:27:05.722 --> 01:27:08.102
Sir Daniel fucking Blake, pal!

1356
01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:11.352
Hey, should be a statue made for you, pal.

1357
01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.190
Fucking Sir Daniel Blake!

1358
01:27:14.731 --> 01:27:16.611
Yer a fucking beauty!

1359
01:27:20.612 --> 01:27:22.322
Yay!

1360
01:27:27.785 --> 01:27:28.995
So, what happens now?

1361
01:27:29.287 --> 01:27:32.747
Right, this is a copy of the caution sheet.

1362
01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:35.129
Because you fully admitted the offences

1363
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:37.209
and you've been of good
character in the past,

1364
01:27:37.503 --> 01:27:40.213
we're cautioning you for the offence
of criminal damage,

1365
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.760
under Section Five of the Public Order Act.

1366
01:27:43.927 --> 01:27:47.137
But please remember
that these can come back

1367
01:27:47.221 --> 01:27:50.141
and haunt you if you re-offend.

1368
01:27:50.224 --> 01:27:52.354
So try to keep yourself out of trouble.

1369
01:27:55.813 --> 01:27:56.863
Aye.

1370
01:27:58.983 --> 01:28:01.243
- See him out, please.
- This way, Mr Blake.

1371
01:28:43.653 --> 01:28:46.413
Dan. Dan!

1372
01:28:47.824 --> 01:28:49.664
Come, I need to talk to you.

1373
01:28:52.203 --> 01:28:53.833
We called you loads of times.

1374
01:29:06.884 --> 01:29:08.014
Dan!

1375
01:29:10.847 --> 01:29:13.017
Mum's been so sad lately.

1376
01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:15.390
Why don't you speak to her?

1377
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:18.020
Don't you have credit on the phone?

1378
01:29:31.325 --> 01:29:32.325
I see you.

1379
01:29:38.249 --> 01:29:40.329
We understand what happened to your heart.

1380
01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:43.047
Mum spoke to one of your neighbours.

1381
01:29:44.756 --> 01:29:46.126
We didn't know about it.

1382
01:29:57.852 --> 01:29:59.102
It's cold out here.

1383
01:30:01.355 --> 01:30:02.355
I'm freezing.

1384
01:30:06.277 --> 01:30:09.357
Please, Daisy, I'm not feeling very well.

1385
01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:12.163
I made you some couscous.

1386
01:30:13.326 --> 01:30:14.986
And Dylan sent you his lollipop.

1387
01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:19.367
He's really missing you, too.

1388
01:30:22.752 --> 01:30:24.382
Just go, Daisy, please.

1389
01:30:28.382 --> 01:30:30.132
Can I ask you one question, Dan?

1390
01:30:32.804 --> 01:30:34.104
Did you help us?

1391
01:30:35.765 --> 01:30:36.965
Suppose so.

1392
01:30:37.183 --> 01:30:38.733
So why can't I help you?

1393
01:30:47.401 --> 01:30:48.401
I'm sorry.

1394
01:30:49.946 --> 01:30:51.406
I'm sorry, Daisy.

1395
01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:54.202
I'm really sorry.

1396
01:31:06.546 --> 01:31:10.216
You know, I'm not usually a nervous person,
Katie, but I'm nervous about this.

1397
01:31:10.508 --> 01:31:11.928
It's only natural, Dan.

1398
01:31:12.051 --> 01:31:13.431
I just want it done, you know?

1399
01:31:13.511 --> 01:31:16.431
Yeah. Well, you're prepared.
You got all your papers.

1400
01:31:16.514 --> 01:31:18.434
You've got a good,
good person representing you.

1401
01:31:18.766 --> 01:31:21.596
And then when you're done,
you can come, come to dinner to celebrate.

1402
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:23.650
The kids are really looking
forward to seeing you.

1403
01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:50.384
Hi, er, Daniel Blake. I've come for my appeal
for the reinstatement of my...

1404
01:31:50.464 --> 01:31:52.474
Employment and Support Allowance.

1405
01:31:57.638 --> 01:31:59.718
- Daniel, hi. Hello. Are you all right?
- Hello.

1406
01:31:59.849 --> 01:32:02.189
- Hi, I'm Katie. I'm a friend of Daniel's.
- Hi.

1407
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:04.650
- You're here for support, yeah?
- Yeah.

1408
01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:12.030
Daniel, your appeal will be heard by
a legally qualified chairperson and a doctor.

1409
01:32:12.612 --> 01:32:14.112
- Aye, fingers crossed.
- Yeah...

1410
01:32:14.238 --> 01:32:16.738
If I lose this appeal,
I'm out on the streets.

1411
01:32:16.866 --> 01:32:20.826
Well, we've got some updated
reports here from your GP,

1412
01:32:21.078 --> 01:32:23.458
your own consultant and your
physiotherapist.

1413
01:32:24.081 --> 01:32:25.211
And they're all furious.

1414
01:32:26.459 --> 01:32:27.709
You're gonna win this, Dan.

1415
01:32:28.502 --> 01:32:30.132
I do this every week.

1416
01:32:32.215 --> 01:32:33.875
- I bet me life on it.
- I told ya.

1417
01:32:35.843 --> 01:32:40.473
Just be yourself,
answer the questions and relax.

1418
01:32:40.890 --> 01:32:42.480
I'm really confident.

1419
01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:45.521
D'you have any questions?

1420
01:32:46.145 --> 01:32:48.515
Well, I've got one or two things
I'd like to get off me chest.

1421
01:32:49.065 --> 01:32:51.315
- But will they listen?
- It's the least they can do.

1422
01:32:51.651 --> 01:32:52.861
And can I go in with him?

1423
01:32:53.069 --> 01:32:54.448
I'll certainly ask. Would you like her to?

1424
01:32:54.528 --> 01:32:55.698
- Yeah. Definitely, yeah.
- Yeah?

1425
01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:58.281
Okay, I'll certainly ask. No problem at all.

1426
01:32:58.532 --> 01:33:00.122
All right. Thank you.

1427
01:33:00.326 --> 01:33:03.036
My pleasure.
I'll just go and see what the score is.

1428
01:33:04.497 --> 01:33:06.537
- Yeah.
- Sounds good, don't it?

1429
01:33:08.459 --> 01:33:09.499
Look at them.

1430
01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:13.970
It's funny, they've got
my life in their hands.

1431
01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:21.561
Thanks, Katie, for coming.

1432
01:33:22.515 --> 01:33:23.845
Thank you for asking me.

1433
01:33:24.475 --> 01:33:26.305
You stubborn old bastard.

1434
01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:34.491
I think I'll go and freshen up, yeah?

1435
01:33:34.694 --> 01:33:35.744
All right.

1436
01:34:28.789 --> 01:34:31.545
Can somebody, er,
phone an ambulance, please? 9-9-9.

1437
01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:33.915
There's a guy collapsed in the toilet.
He's flat out.

1438
01:34:34.045 --> 01:34:36.705
Phone 9-9-9. Somebody, please.

1439
01:34:37.256 --> 01:34:38.376
Dan!

1440
01:34:38.549 --> 01:34:40.339
No! Dan!

1441
01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.558
Just had a heart attack.
Yeah, two breaths, please.

1442
01:34:44.638 --> 01:34:45.848
Oh, Dan!

1443
01:34:46.223 --> 01:34:49.443
- Just the two breaths...
- Is he breathing?

1444
01:34:49.769 --> 01:34:51.479
Oh, Dan.

1445
01:34:51.604 --> 01:34:52.814
Listen, we're trying to help
him as much as we can.

1446
01:34:52.938 --> 01:34:55.569
No, no, no, please keep going,
please keep going. Don't stop.

1447
01:34:55.649 --> 01:34:56.859
I'm afraid we've lost him.

1448
01:34:57.151 --> 01:35:01.661
No, don't say that,
please don't say that. No.

1449
01:35:02.656 --> 01:35:05.236
- No, please!
- I'm so sorry.

1450
01:35:05.368 --> 01:35:06.408
I'm sorry.

1451
01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:09.160
- Please...
- Where's the ambulance now?

1452
01:35:09.497 --> 01:35:11.747
- Please.
- No response at all.

1453
01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.760
Please. Please try again.

1454
01:36:11.851 --> 01:36:12.891
Erm...

1455
01:36:13.811 --> 01:36:18.901
They call this a "pauper's funeral"
because it's the cheapest slot, at 9:00.

1456
01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.900
But Dan wasn't a pauper to us.

1457
01:36:24.738 --> 01:36:27.488
He gave us things that money can't buy.

1458
01:36:30.953 --> 01:36:32.753
When he died, I found this on him.

1459
01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:37.503
He always used to write in pencil.

1460
01:36:39.503 --> 01:36:40.553
Erm...

1461
01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:45.760
And he wanted to read it at his appeal
but he never got the chance to.

1462
01:36:48.721 --> 01:36:51.601
And I swear that this lovely man,

1463
01:36:52.683 --> 01:36:54.063
had so much more to give,

1464
01:36:56.103 --> 01:36:59.323
and that the State drove him
to an early grave.

1465
01:37:03.486 --> 01:37:04.776
And this is what he wrote.

1466
01:37:07.281 --> 01:37:12.371
"I am not a client, a customer,
nor a service user.

1467
01:37:13.913 --> 01:37:18.793
"I am not a shirker, a scrounger,
a beggar, nor a thief.

1468
01:37:19.877 --> 01:37:23.797
"I'm not a National Insurance Number
or blip on a screen.

1469
01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:29.220
"I paid my dues, never a penny short,
and proud to do so.

1470
01:37:30.804 --> 01:37:35.774
"I don't tug the forelock, but look my
neighbour in the eye and help him if I can.

1471
01:37:37.019 --> 01:37:39.439
"I don't accept or seek charity.

1472
01:37:41.357 --> 01:37:46.447
"My name is Daniel Blake.
I am a man, not a dog.

1473
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:49.821
"As such, I demand my rights.

1474
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.450
"I demand you treat me with respect.

1475
01:37:55.162 --> 01:37:58.542
"I, Daniel Blake, am a citizen,

1476
01:37:59.833 --> 01:38:02.423
"nothing more and nothing less."

1477
01:38:03.671 --> 01:38:04.761
Thank you.
