2
00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.914
Stop the car, Chad!
I need to get out!

3
00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:23.882
- You all right, norm?
- You said we were going home!

4
00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.851
I'm in fucking pain,
Chad, please!

5
00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:27.286
Catch this fucker
and you're on!

6
00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:29.455
- You're mad!
- Watch the hare, Tyson.

7
00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:31.023
Down there! Down there!

8
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.035
It's burning!
It's not fucking funny!

9
00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:45.070
Shut up, Norman.
You're putting the dog off.

10
00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.172
Fuck the dog!

11
00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:48.674
- Give it some, Chad.
- - Yeah.

12
00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:50.909
- Come on, Ty. Yeah!
- That's it, Ty!

13
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:51.944
He can't drive!

14
00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.512
Keep her straight, mush.

15
00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.681
I think I'm gonna die!

16
00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:01.987
Broadside it!

17
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.124
That's it, Ty.
Kick the back end out, mush.

18
00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.961
I fucking mean it, Tyson!

19
00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.830
That's it! That's it, Ty!

20
00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:16.268
That was mint, mate.

21
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.504
I mean it,
I'm having you, Tyson.
I'm fucking having you!

22
00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:20.772
- Get it!
- Down there, down there!

23
00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.745
Fuck's sake, Norman!
You made me fucking crash.

24
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:30.015
- Up yours, Tyson.
- All right, let's have a look at you.

25
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.553
Good little bitch, ain't you?

26
00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.288
Gotta get you fit, though.

27
00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.324
What's up, norm?

28
00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.360
Don't fucking touch me, Chad!

29
00:02:41.362 --> 00:02:43.028
It's all right.
It's only a poxy cut.

30
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.530
It's fucking broke, innit?

31
00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:46.765
Well, what you doing
falling out the car,
then, you dinny?

32
00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:50.035
- Got pushed, didn't I?
- Shut up, Norman,
you little snout.

33
00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:51.670
I swear
on the mother's cunt, Chad.

34
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.040
Come on, let's gel.

35
00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.002
Fuck off!

36
00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.053
Have that.

37
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.857
Oi!

38
00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.660
Not over there, you div!

39
00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:49.995
Right,

40
00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.863
tens on the gavva's nose.

41
00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.903
One fucking go, I said.

42
00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.471
Right, my turn.

43
00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.608
Yeah, take a load of that.

44
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.576
Right, that's it.
Tens each.

45
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:04.576
Come on, ten.

46
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:07.746
- I weren't playin'
in that one.
- Yes, you were.

47
00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.815
- All right, once more?
- It's now 30.

48
00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.389
Have that.

49
00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:18.991
You fat Joey.

50
00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:20.692
Fuck's sake, Norman.

51
00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.893
It's well gammy, kel.

52
00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.128
Gammy dodger more like.

53
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.596
All right, maggot?

54
00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.199
I think it's
definitely fractious.

55
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.600
All right?

56
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.536
Stop your flapping, Norman!

57
00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.872
I'm not looking after you
like this, no way.

58
00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:35.674
You're meant to be working
for me.

59
00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.943
He's broken his leg,
you have, Chad.

60
00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:41.046
- I've gotta go
to hospital, kel.
- You know you can't do that.

61
00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:42.648
Hypochondrio.

62
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.385
Ain't much use now 'round here,
are you, you dinny?

63
00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:47.953
Hardly a Joey now.

64
00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:50.122
Do you want me
to get you some painkillers?

65
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:53.692
Oi, Chad, you've seriously
gone and broke his leg now.

66
00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:55.560
Weren't me, love.

67
00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.229
Fucking goat, Chad.

68
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:59.898
You know you've gotta keep him
out the trailer, mini.

69
00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.170
Make us a cup of tea,
then, kel.

70
00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.571
You do it.

71
00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.807
And make sure Tyson
does his school work.

72
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.243
Where are you going?

73
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.512
Told you,

74
00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:15.447
I'm taking mini
to the pet shop.

75
00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.749
- She wants a terrapin.
- Terra fucking who?

76
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.651
Turtles, dad.

77
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.188
Need some scrilla, Chad.

78
00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.626
Always wedging me, ent she, Ty?

79
00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.663
Give us a kiss.

80
00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.099
See you later.

81
00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:35.701
Gel on.

82
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.708
Make your dad a tea, then.

83
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.443
All right, Ty.
Where you going?

84
00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:50.449
You got tiddles? Go on.

85
00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:51.850
Oi.

86
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.953
Where d'you think you're going?
- To the dog.

87
00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:56.955
- Ain't you got homeworks?
- No.

88
00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:58.623
You never had to homework.

89
00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.293
I never went to school.

90
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:03.328
Yeah, and look at you now.

91
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.230
Let him go play.

92
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.938
Go on, then, son.
Piss off.

93
00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.210
Make us a tea, then.

94
00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.986
Got something to show you.

95
00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:30.922
About what?

96
00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:34.526
We're gonna protest
about your brother.

97
00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.610
Huh? Huh?

98
00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.019
Tyson.

99
00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:02.254
Tyson!

100
00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:06.691
Knobhead!

101
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.927
Bennett!

102
00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.196
Bennett!

103
00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:20.038
Bennett!

104
00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.411
Go get the paint
you chored, mush.

105
00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:28.814
Get some fucking clothes on
whilst you're at it.

106
00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.516
Your Joey's
a fucking animal, Colby.

107
00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:33.985
So what's the plan
with the motor?

108
00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.354
Gonna make a complaint
for Bryan.

109
00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:39.324
Too late for him, mush.
Ten's a ten.

110
00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:40.759
I ain't having it.

111
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.361
Can't.
He were innocence.

112
00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:45.831
Besides, he's your brother.
He don't like prison.

113
00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:48.200
Well, this ain't gonna
get him out, is it?

114
00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.968
Just you wait
'til it's your turn.

115
00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:00.345
Water.

116
00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.848
Water, doggy.

117
00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:07.586
I got some brushes for you,
chaddy.

118
00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.256
What d'you want me
to do with them?

119
00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:13.425
Well, you're the artist, Chad.
You tell me.

120
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.934
You need a window, Chad.

121
00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:25.170
Worzel here can sort that out.

122
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.408
Fuck happened? Mush?

123
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.710
What is it?

124
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.379
What have I done now, eh?

125
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:36.481
Let's look at you.
Let's look at you.

126
00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.252
- What happened, mush?
- Dog's dead.

127
00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:43.121
- What do you mean,
the dog's dead?
- Dog's dead, dad.

128
00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:44.956
Worzel's fire exploded.

129
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.559
- What the fuck?
- Don't ask me, Chad.

130
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.161
You could have killed Tyson,
you dumb gummidgey fuck!

131
00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:51.596
He's gotta go, col.

132
00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:54.032
I don't care
if he's a jubby dinlo.
He's a fucking liability.

133
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.934
What do you want me
to do 'bout it?

134
00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.670
- He's gonna kill
one of the kids.
- Don't be a Fanny, Chad.

135
00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:00.238
There's nothing Fanny about it.

136
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.107
All right, calm down,
calm down.

137
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:04.109
All right, Tyson?
Cushty, son?

138
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.477
It's all right, mush.
Weren't your fault.

139
00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:07.145
We'll get you a news one.

140
00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:09.114
You owe me a new dog, worzel.

141
00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:10.482
Can I keep that one then,
eh, Chad?

142
00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:12.417
You can fuckin' eat it
for all I care.

143
00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.653
I've had enough
of his shit, col.

144
00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:25.597
Blessed are the cracked, Chad.

145
00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.032
Karl Marx said that.

146
00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:28.400
Karl fucking who?

147
00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.543
Can I cremate the dog,
then, eh, col?

148
00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:39.711
Huh?

149
00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.762
You gonna sleep up there?

150
00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.398
No.

151
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.769
Look, he were a good dog, mush.

152
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:39.871
But your dad'll get you
another one.

153
00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:43.008
Come on,
let's go get some warm.

154
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:56.254
That's them pills you're on,
les.

155
00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:58.857
I'm running
'round the fire, look.

156
00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:01.893
I'm going 'round and 'round.
I'm going 'round and 'round.

157
00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.428
'Round and 'round!

158
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:13.772
My dad once told me
the world were flat.

159
00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:15.740
"From where I'm looking, son,"
he said,

160
00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:18.877
"from where I'm looking,
the world is flat."

161
00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.046
I believed him.
I still do.

162
00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:23.982
- It's a fucking ball.
- Now, before you start,

163
00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:25.950
I don't give a fuck
about outer space

164
00:11:25.952 --> 00:11:28.820
or the view from up there.
Where's Chad?

165
00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:31.222
And I've told Chad the same.
You ask him.

166
00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:32.157
Where is he?
You ask him.

167
00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:33.892
He'd tell ya.

168
00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.393
It's flat.

169
00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.564
Get you a pond, mush.

170
00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:41.332
Innit, terrapin?

171
00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:47.505
God said you pass it down
from father to son.

172
00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:50.241
From father, son, grandson.

173
00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:51.509
Hallelujah!

174
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:54.612
What right-thinking man
would say wrong?

175
00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:57.282
As it were in the beginning,
is now,

176
00:11:57.284 --> 00:12:00.585
ever shall be,
so help me god.

177
00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.087
- Amen!
- Fucksake, Bennett!

178
00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:04.322
Fucking hell, gummidge.

179
00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:05.824
Kenny's a fucking idiot.

180
00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:08.460
I've stood
up top the highest hill,

181
00:12:08.462 --> 00:12:10.128
climbed up the highest tree,

182
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.130
looked as far
as my eyeballs'll stretch.

183
00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:13.965
You know what, Tyson?

184
00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:16.434
- It was still flat.
- - Flat, flat.

185
00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:18.336
What about the moon, then?
How do you explain that?

186
00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:21.339
I never did care for anything
any gorgie did say,

187
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.008
nor his majesty the queen,
nor the army.

188
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.643
What my dad said were the truth

189
00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:28.079
and I'd fight any fucker
who says else.

190
00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:31.483
Your bloody dad
telling the same...

191
00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:34.152
...bloody story
every bloody night.

192
00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:38.423
I mean,
does he actually believe
we buy all that bollocks?

193
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.592
Tyson actually does.

194
00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:44.529
Next thing is you
being born in a manger
to a bloody virgin Mary.

195
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.831
You used to think him funny.

196
00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.867
Yeah, until he got Bryan
sent down.

197
00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.803
Tell you something, love.

198
00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:53.605
You get lalled,
I'm not sticking round here

199
00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:56.541
listening to him harp on.
No chance.

200
00:12:56.543 --> 00:13:00.111
You did say we weren't living
with your dad forever, Chad.

201
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.513
Where are the kids?

202
00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.648
Did you hear what I'm saying?

203
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.651
I'm not asking you
to move into an house.

204
00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.388
Come on, Kelly cutler.

205
00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.627
It's the weekend.

206
00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:19.864
You did promise.
You know that, Chad?

207
00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.672
I do promise.

208
00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:37.949
You know it's compilated.

209
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.225
You can't stand up to your dad,

210
00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:48.760
that's your problem.

211
00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:50.795
I'll show you my problem.

212
00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:51.189
You woke me up for this?

213
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:52.690
I wanna talk to you.

214
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.927
What's happening, then, Chad?

215
00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:57.362
I'm tired.

216
00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:59.430
Come on, talk to me, boy.

217
00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.502
Nothing going on.
Sleep, that's all.

218
00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:09.807
So why the fuck
did you behave like such
a little twat yesterday?

219
00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:13.945
Worse than the kids, you was.

220
00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.315
Fucking ignore me!

221
00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:19.350
What the fuck
you done that for?

222
00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:21.119
You got no idea, Chad.

223
00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:23.254
No idea the troubles I've had

224
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.856
putting all this together.

225
00:15:24.858 --> 00:15:26.224
And here you are, my eldest,

226
00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:27.892
acting like the prize div.

227
00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:29.227
You know what my dad
once said to me?

228
00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:30.628
Yeah, I do.

229
00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:34.966
What the fuck is
the matter with you, then?

230
00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:37.302
I'm just trying
to look after my family, col.

231
00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.740
What you say?

232
00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:45.777
I'm your family.

233
00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.413
You're forgetting
who you are, boy.

234
00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:54.519
I swear to god,
i will fucking smash
your puny little fucking skull

235
00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:57.155
and then I will pluck
every little pubic hair

236
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:59.157
out of your bollocks

237
00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:01.392
if I think you're getting
anywhere close

238
00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:04.329
to being a fucking gorgie.
- Come here.

239
00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:07.699
Give your dad a kiss.

240
00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:09.033
All right, then, Tyson?

241
00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:13.404
All right? Morning.
Glad you're here, me boy.

242
00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:16.007
Just saying,
we got a job for you, we have.

243
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.809
Spell "free Bryan."

244
00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:20.545
Fuh, fuh, eh...

245
00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.848
Right, come on, you do it.

246
00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.919
Right, there you go,
right there.

247
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:29.454
Spell it.

248
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:32.357
There we go.
That's it.

249
00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:34.125
Now we're a proper crew.

250
00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.030
You in with me and Ty,
then, Chad?

251
00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:42.834
That's it.

252
00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.772
There you are.
A little bit more.

253
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.341
That's it, you've got it.

254
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.776
Free Bryan?

255
00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:53.011
Yeah.

256
00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.284
Just the tip of the brush.
That's it.

257
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.295
Write "fuck gavvas", Tyson.

258
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.016
Could've at least chored
a decent car.

259
00:18:05.018 --> 00:18:07.185
First car I ever chored
was a 6r4.

260
00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:08.719
No, you never.

261
00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:44.655
Have that!

262
00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:54.665
Let's go again.

263
00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:56.234
Let's go to St. Paul's
and find Johnson.

264
00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:57.902
No, man, let's keep on
at lovage.

265
00:18:57.904 --> 00:18:59.237
The motherfucker needs baiting.

266
00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:00.538
We've been at him
all day long.

267
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.806
I'm gonna gel.
You lot carry on.

268
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:01.806
- Right, I'm driving.
- I'm driving.

269
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.475
No, I'm fucking driving.
I'm driving. I'm driving.

270
00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.477
- Let me drive.
- I'm driving.

271
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.945
How am I gonna get home?

272
00:19:07.947 --> 00:19:09.413
In that.

273
00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:11.782
Ah, great.

274
00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:13.651
The hottest car
in gloucestershire.

275
00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.620
Every gavva in town
looking for us!

276
00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:17.955
Fuckin' hell.
- Come on, mush.

277
00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.192
All right there, Chad?

278
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.694
You know where he is.

279
00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.637
Let's see him, then.

280
00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.473
Six minutes.

281
00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.476
A clear winner.
Should improve, too.

282
00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.279
A beauty.

283
00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.049
You serious about this, then?

284
00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.286
Needs a bit of clearing up,

285
00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:23.955
but with a bit of work...

286
00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:25.723
Never mind about that, Noah.

287
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.158
It's all right, innit?

288
00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:30.661
Got potentials.

289
00:20:30.663 --> 00:20:31.896
Thing is, Chad,

290
00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:35.166
you and your Kelly and the kids
are welcome up here...

291
00:20:35.168 --> 00:20:38.736
...but we can't be having
your old man and his whole lot
pitching up.

292
00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.538
We're a settled community,
no troubles,

293
00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.106
and I wanna keep it that way.

294
00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:43.741
It's all I want too.

295
00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.676
Somewhere near school
for Kelly and the kids.

296
00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.111
Good.

297
00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:49.614
There is one other thing, Chad.

298
00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:53.317
I'm not doing this
behind your Colby's back.

299
00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:55.586
I can't be on the wrong side
of your dad.

300
00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:59.390
Listen, I wanna take it.

301
00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:02.627
It's yours
unless I hear otherwise.

302
00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.296
Means what I said, though.

303
00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:08.499
Give me a few days
to sort my shit out, okay?

304
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:09.767
Cushty?

305
00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.270
Thanks, Noah.

306
00:22:01.054 --> 00:22:02.453
All right, Chad?

307
00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.491
Nice little stunt
you pulled earlier.

308
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.262
Do you think I give a shit
about some driving misdemeanor?

309
00:22:11.264 --> 00:22:13.364
That was very original, Chad.
Well done.

310
00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.267
Was it daddy's idea?

311
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:18.469
Did daddy tell you to do it,
did he?

312
00:22:18.471 --> 00:22:20.004
Don't know
what you're on about.

313
00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:23.307
How's Kelly?

314
00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:28.312
Getting old, ain't he,
your bitch?

315
00:22:28.314 --> 00:22:30.247
All right, trousers.

316
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:33.951
Richard cutler,
you're under arrest

317
00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:36.020
on suspicion
of driving a stolen car.

318
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:36.020
You do not
have to say anything,

319
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:39.190
but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention,

320
00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:42.460
when questioned, anything
you later rely on in court.

321
00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:45.296
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

322
00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.513
Could've fucking murdered you.

323
00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:38.883
What were you doing
up there anyway?

324
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.819
- Up where?
- You know where.

325
00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:43.821
I know his poxy site.

326
00:23:43.823 --> 00:23:45.289
Just having a mooch.

327
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.058
A mooch? Stroll on.

328
00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.996
Gotta buy Tyson a bitch, ent I?

329
00:23:51.998 --> 00:23:53.831
It's his birthday next week.

330
00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:56.267
Hadn't even got up there.
Lovage just come
out of nowhere.

331
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:57.535
Prick.

332
00:23:57.537 --> 00:23:59.036
Stood no chances.

333
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.873
Right.

334
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.921
Got a job for you tonight,
all right?

335
00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:19.190
Fuck that.

336
00:24:19.192 --> 00:24:20.991
Some fatements in this one.

337
00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:22.993
Can't be doing with all that,
not tonight, mush.

338
00:24:22.995 --> 00:24:25.396
Oh, well, that's tough.

339
00:24:25.398 --> 00:24:27.198
It's all set for tonight.

340
00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:32.570
What's the matter with you?

341
00:24:32.572 --> 00:24:35.105
- What?
- You heard.

342
00:24:35.107 --> 00:24:36.740
It's Sunday.
Why has it gotta be tonight?

343
00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:38.542
'Cause I fucking said so!

344
00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:48.919
Can we turn
this fuckin' music off?

345
00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:01.932
Mama.

346
00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.770
Mama!

347
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.975
<i> And we actually</i>
<i> removed a bay window</i>

348
00:25:10.977 --> 00:25:13.410
<i> and we found it under there</i>
<i> and I've had it ever since,</i>

349
00:25:13.412 --> 00:25:15.412
<i> but my husband</i>
<i> just keeps saying</i>
<i> it's a bit of old tat.</i>

350
00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:17.848
<i> But I just thought, well,</i>
<i> I'll bring it along.</i>

351
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.083
Bit of old tat.
Have you worn

352
00:25:19.085 --> 00:25:21.285
this bit of old tat?

353
00:25:21.287 --> 00:25:23.420
What does that say, Ty?

354
00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:25.222
Ha ha, you can't read!

355
00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:27.625
- Read it to him, Tyson.
- You little div.

356
00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.430
Oi, that hurts.

357
00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:35.900
<i> Um, no, I just liked it,</i>

358
00:25:35.902 --> 00:25:38.002
<i> and I just-</i>
<i> I just kept it.</i>

359
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.170
Are you coming, then, or what?

360
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:42.940
- I'm coming.
- You're not going anywhere.

361
00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:46.510
...a Collier de chien,
a dog's collar ornament,
in diamonds...

362
00:25:46.512 --> 00:25:48.345
Eight grand.

363
00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:49.513
Eight grand for that?

364
00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:50.981
Fuck off.

365
00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:53.817
<i> ...eight or nine</i>
<i> thousand pounds.</i>

366
00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:55.252
Pff.

367
00:25:55.254 --> 00:25:56.687
<i> Oh, my god.</i>

368
00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:59.790
Come on, then, Chad.
Let's gel.

369
00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:02.593
Listen, Kenny, I don't know
anything what Colby's on about.

370
00:26:02.595 --> 00:26:04.662
I never worked a Sunday
in my life.

371
00:26:04.664 --> 00:26:06.263
Calls himself Christian.

372
00:26:06.265 --> 00:26:08.032
You wants to do it,
you go and do it.

373
00:26:08.034 --> 00:26:10.267
Me, I'm not into that shit
no more.

374
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:12.570
Just want a quiet life, me.

375
00:26:12.572 --> 00:26:13.837
No troubles.

376
00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:16.006
What the fuck you on about?

377
00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:18.175
You can't sit 'round here
all night.

378
00:26:18.177 --> 00:26:20.210
Come on, Chad.
Sort it out, mush.

379
00:26:24.282 --> 00:26:26.116
What's the matter with you?

380
00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:27.585
Nothing.

381
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.121
- Just says it.
- Might as well go.

382
00:26:31.123 --> 00:26:33.791
I know you wanna go anyway.
Just fucking go.

383
00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:37.394
I'm staying here
with my family tonight.

384
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:41.265
It's our anniversary.

385
00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:44.368
That's bollocks.
I know it's not
your anniversary.

386
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.471
- It is now.
- Ty, your dad's flapping.

387
00:26:47.473 --> 00:26:50.307
- What's happened to him, mush?
- Fuck off, Kenny.

388
00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:52.610
I know what you're doing.
Just fuck off.

389
00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:01.885
Sampson says you're on strike.

390
00:27:01.887 --> 00:27:04.054
You a fucking miner now
or what?

391
00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:06.323
Kenny's jobbing this one, col.
He just said so.

392
00:27:06.325 --> 00:27:08.025
- What the fuck
are you on about?
- I never.

393
00:27:08.027 --> 00:27:10.561
- Kenny's on it, col.
- Is he fuck.

394
00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:13.764
Tyson's got more chance
of bossing it.

395
00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.902
What do you say, then, Ty?

396
00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:22.640
Wanna go on a job?

397
00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:26.110
Yeah? Bit of driving?

398
00:27:26.112 --> 00:27:27.077
Yeah.

399
00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.957
Can I have a fag
for our mum, please?

400
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.627
Go on, piss off.

401
00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:46.230
Where's fat cunt Norman?

402
00:27:46.232 --> 00:27:48.532
- Norman!
- Leave him alone, mush.

403
00:27:48.534 --> 00:27:51.101
- Where's windows?
- Choring us a motor.

404
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.105
- You been drinking, mush?
- I might have had
a few ciders.

405
00:27:55.107 --> 00:27:56.407
You're off your head,
you are, samp.

406
00:27:56.409 --> 00:27:59.009
Shut up flapping, lest.
On and on.

407
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:01.879
- He's got slippers on, Chad.
- He's got slippers on, Chad.

408
00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:05.649
Ty, you little fucking devil.

409
00:28:11.223 --> 00:28:13.323
Stop being a dinlo, Sampson.

410
00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:49.993
All right,
who's gonna get the petrol?

411
00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:51.328
Not me.

412
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.031
Right, lest, get me 40 fags
as well.

413
00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:56.967
Why is it me
who's gotta get his face on TV?

414
00:28:56.969 --> 00:28:58.602
'Cause you's
the most good-looking.

415
00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:01.739
For fuck's sake, Chad.

416
00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.042
Just 'cause Norman ain't here.

417
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.377
- Bye, lest.
- Fuck off.

418
00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:11.815
I swear on the mother's cunt,
them pills Lester's on,

419
00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:13.217
they're no good
for no one, mush.

420
00:29:13.219 --> 00:29:15.352
Made him worser if anything.

421
00:29:15.354 --> 00:29:17.621
I took one once.
Dreamt I sucked off a dog...

422
00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:19.690
...spunk an' all.

423
00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:23.360
- What were it?
- Were antidepressives.

424
00:29:23.362 --> 00:29:24.895
No, what were the dog?

425
00:29:24.897 --> 00:29:27.097
Oh, it were a labrador.

426
00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:31.001
- It was
a nice blonde retriever.
- You sick son of a cunt.

427
00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:34.037
You're a sick fucking bastard,
you know that, Sampson?

428
00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:41.645
All right?

429
00:29:41.647 --> 00:29:43.814
- I've got keys, Chad.
- Gel, gel!

430
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:48.252
Gel, gel.

431
00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:52.422
Lalled choring the petrol.
Quick, Chad, gel.

432
00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:54.892
What the fuck
you done that for?
I gave you the scrilla.

433
00:29:54.894 --> 00:29:56.760
I told you,
I'm not getting my face on TV.

434
00:29:56.762 --> 00:29:58.028
You fucking div.

435
00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.963
You don't think got cameras
at the pumps?

436
00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:02.032
- What?
- Mongs of petrol in here now.

437
00:30:02.034 --> 00:30:04.234
If we get in a chase
and I ain't got no fags,

438
00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:07.404
I'm having you, Lester,
I'm fucking having you.

439
00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:50.180
<i>Is it true we come from fishes?</i>

440
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.283
What'd you say?

441
00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:55.452
It's what they said at school.

442
00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:59.857
You just listen to me, me boy,
and listen good.

443
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.362
No one is about to tell me
i come from the arse of an ape.

444
00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:08.966
Or that your granddaddy
were a goldfish.

445
00:31:08.968 --> 00:31:10.334
Really.

446
00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.403
What a load of bollocks.

447
00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:19.910
You really think god made us
from a fish?

448
00:31:19.912 --> 00:31:21.645
Teacher said.

449
00:31:21.647 --> 00:31:24.147
Well, they're fannies, then.
Great big fannies.

450
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:26.049
Don't you listen to 'em, Ty.

451
00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:26.850
Don't listen to 'em.

452
00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:31.388
From fishes.
Yeah, well,
maybe her ancestors.

453
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.357
Not mine, not yours.

454
00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:37.861
I thought school was supposed
to teach you common senses.

455
00:31:37.863 --> 00:31:40.297
I don't like it there.

456
00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:42.532
Fucking waste of time
if you ask me.

457
00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:45.569
They're trying
to control your mind.

458
00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:50.707
That's why I never
did send Chad to school.

459
00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:53.777
You've gotta stand up
against these cunts, Tyson.

460
00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:58.782
So they don't trespass
against us.

461
00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.633
Yeah, it were like
a fucking museum!

462
00:33:56.635 --> 00:33:58.335
That were some fate, that.

463
00:33:58.337 --> 00:33:59.803
Did you see
all them regal outgowns?

464
00:33:59.805 --> 00:34:03.273
I chored one of his wigs,
wrapped it all in his gown.

465
00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:07.511
He were a judge.
He were a fucking judge!

466
00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.416
First little stretch I done...

467
00:34:12.418 --> 00:34:13.650
Oi! Tyson!

468
00:34:13.652 --> 00:34:15.252
Chad would have been
a bit younger than you.

469
00:34:15.254 --> 00:34:17.521
About five he was, I think.

470
00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:19.022
Yeah.

471
00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:23.393
Everyone does a bit of time,
you know, sooner or later.

472
00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:27.931
Can be god's medicine,
prison can be, Tyson.

473
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.068
Teaches you what's important.

474
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.102
Evening, Kelly.

475
00:34:32.104 --> 00:34:35.205
Ty's gotta go to bed now.
He's got school tomorrow.

476
00:34:35.207 --> 00:34:36.940
Could I just finish my story?

477
00:34:36.942 --> 00:34:39.109
Don't go filling his head
with all this jank, col.

478
00:34:39.111 --> 00:34:40.677
We was talking about his dog.

479
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:41.912
Don't ignore me,
Tyson cutler.

480
00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:43.847
Get your
skinny little arse out.

481
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:45.982
I tell you, that school's
been rokkering him
some right wrongs.

482
00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:48.585
Say what you like.
He's still going.

483
00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:56.760
All right, then.
Listen to your ma.

484
00:34:56.762 --> 00:34:59.196
- Don't want to.
- I know. No one does.

485
00:34:59.198 --> 00:35:00.864
But I say so.

486
00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.067
I'm not bloody
having this, col.

487
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:05.268
Kel.

488
00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.672
Dogs can only
play with cats so long

489
00:35:08.674 --> 00:35:11.041
before it's the dog
that gets scratched.

490
00:35:28.927 --> 00:35:30.994
That's rapid response,
that is, Chad.

491
00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:36.533
I'll deal with them.
Just get everything in the Van.

492
00:35:36.535 --> 00:35:38.335
I'm fucking
coming with you, Chad.

493
00:35:38.337 --> 00:35:40.604
- I'm not staying
with the fatements.
- What about you, samps?

494
00:35:40.606 --> 00:35:42.272
Well, I'm not missing
a fucking chase.

495
00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:50.847
All right, who we got, then?

496
00:35:50.849 --> 00:35:51.781
We got carlin.

497
00:35:51.783 --> 00:35:53.250
And that fuckhead Roberts.

498
00:35:53.252 --> 00:35:54.918
Roberts is
a fucking awesome driver.

499
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.486
Is he fuck.

500
00:35:59.691 --> 00:36:01.291
Stop touching me, Sampson.

501
00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:12.035
Do your drunk driving, Chad.
Do your drunk driving.

502
00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:20.076
- All right, get the fire thingy.
- - On it, mush.

503
00:36:20.078 --> 00:36:22.112
- Oi, what you doing, Sampson?
- Time to get off-road.

504
00:36:22.114 --> 00:36:23.680
No, my fire extinguisher!

505
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.682
I chored that.
Oi, Chad, tell him to let me--

506
00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:27.150
what the fuck
is wrong with you, Lester?

507
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.956
On Ricky's corner, mush.

508
00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:39.396
All right, let it rip, samps.

509
00:36:39.398 --> 00:36:41.565
Fucking have that!

510
00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.734
Jesus fucking Christ!

511
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.476
Let me bail out, Chad.

512
00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:55.045
I know a bird
who lives 'round here.

513
00:36:55.047 --> 00:36:56.713
Gavvas are still
right behind us.

514
00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.448
Who gives a fuck?

515
00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:03.220
He's a proper dirty sex pest,
he is.

516
00:37:03.222 --> 00:37:05.922
Didn't have to jump.
I was just about to stop.

517
00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:08.725
Fuck you doing, Chad?

518
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:11.895
Told you, I fucking hate chases
without fags.

519
00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:15.265
You forgot 'em, Lester.
You go get 'em.

520
00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:17.767
Fucking not going in there.
You'll leave me behind.

521
00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:20.103
Off your fucking head,
you are, Chad.

522
00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:31.014
I got the money.
I got the money.

523
00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.283
20 denmans.

524
00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.920
No, 40.

525
00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:40.890
And a pack of maltesers.

526
00:37:43.428 --> 00:37:44.628
Keep the change.

527
00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:53.436
- Cushty, mush.
- - Hurry up. Hurry up.

528
00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.618
I think you should actually
stop smoking, Chad.

529
00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:37.781
You sure, Chad?

530
00:41:23.482 --> 00:41:25.515
No, no. Fuck!

531
00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:28.751
Oh, f--

532
00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:30.753
oh.

533
00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:32.522
Fuck.

534
00:41:32.524 --> 00:41:34.257
Oh, fuck.

535
00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.128
You fucking bastard!

536
00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:24.467
You could have
fucking picked me up.

537
00:43:24.469 --> 00:43:26.235
Four hours I walked back.

538
00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:28.905
I were waiting for you
at the tree.

539
00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.708
What happened, then, son?

540
00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:36.045
Rabid response,
that's what happened.

541
00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.382
Start at the beginning.

542
00:43:39.384 --> 00:43:41.551
I fucking killed trousers.

543
00:43:41.553 --> 00:43:45.688
- Who?
- Trousers. Lovage's bitch.

544
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.390
Oh, right. Yeah.

545
00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:49.659
Who was they in the house?

546
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.796
Who gives a fuck?
Come on, sit down.

547
00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:57.600
Have an amaretto,
a little father and sonly.

548
00:43:57.602 --> 00:43:59.068
Tell me what happened.

549
00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:08.811
Well, fuck ya.

550
00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.625
<i> ...ever be able to</i> .

551

Chad.

563
00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:20.416
Chad, wake up.
You're on the news.

564
00:45:20.418 --> 00:45:21.617
<i> This follows a series</i>

by the same

568
00:45:28.093 --> 00:45:31.260
National news.
For fuck's sake, Chad.

569
00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:36.132
They're gonna
come after you now,
you know they will.

570
00:45:36.134 --> 00:45:38.634
- I need to go
back to sleep, kel.
- No way.

571
00:45:38.636 --> 00:45:40.136
You're doing the school run.

572
00:45:40.138 --> 00:45:42.105
I'm taking Norman
to the hospital.

573
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.809
- He's under warrant, kel.
- I know he is.

574
00:45:46.811 --> 00:45:49.078
That's your fucking fault
as well.

575
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.814
And worzel bloody burnt
the kids' slippers.

576
00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:54.083
I can't be living
with the pissy arse
much longer.

577
00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:58.020
All right, monkey.

578
00:45:58.022 --> 00:45:59.922
Leave your dad alone.

579
00:46:01.226 --> 00:46:04.260
- What time did you get back?
- Never you mind.

580
00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:06.362
- You ready for school?
- Don't want to.

581
00:46:06.364 --> 00:46:07.930
I want to go to the fair
with Colby.

582
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:09.232
You've got three minutes
to make it to the car.

583
00:46:09.234 --> 00:46:10.900
You hear me, Ty?

584
00:46:10.902 --> 00:46:12.401
Tyson?

585
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.889
All right, Tyson,
let your granddad in.

586
00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:36.993
Out the car, worzel.

587
00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.729
Aw! Leave him alone, Chad.

588
00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:43.633
You heard.
Out the car, gummidge.

589
00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:50.873
I ain't moving
whilst he's in here.

590
00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:52.408
Don't be childish.

591
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.743
Worse than the kids.

592
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.515
All right, out.

593
00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:01.517
No chickens at school today.

594
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:15.631
Fucking national news, dad.

595
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:19.669
- Weren't you in the news, son.
- Might as well have been.

596
00:47:19.671 --> 00:47:21.704
Your dad's a legend, Tyson.

597
00:47:23.508 --> 00:47:24.941
Hiding under cows.

598
00:47:24.943 --> 00:47:26.876
Don't teach you that at school,
do they?

599
00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:31.714
Don't you ever think
what actually happens in there?

600
00:47:31.716 --> 00:47:33.349
You know what I reckon of it,
don't ya?

601
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:35.985
You two'd be better off coming
to the fair with your granddad.

602
00:47:35.987 --> 00:47:37.687
Oi, they're my fucking kids,
col,

603
00:47:37.689 --> 00:47:39.622
and I do what I like with 'em.
Give us a kiss.

604
00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:43.593
No swearing, not at school.

605
00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.096
No swearing?
What's that about?

606
00:47:47.098 --> 00:47:48.698
God given right to swear.

607
00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:51.167
Oi, Tyson,

608
00:47:51.169 --> 00:47:53.502
tell your teachers
to go fuck their mothers!

609
00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.041
They ain't gonna airlift you,
is they, Norman?

610
00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:01.110
- All right, kel.
- Get your fat arse ready.

611
00:48:01.112 --> 00:48:02.445
I'm coming!

612
00:48:02.447 --> 00:48:04.981
Kelly, Chad has sent me
to protect you.

613
00:48:04.983 --> 00:48:06.682
You stay away from me,
Bennett, you hear?

614
00:48:06.684 --> 00:48:09.185
- I got a chicken for you, kel.
- Stuff it.

615
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.497
Shh.

616
00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:31.707
He's a wrong 'un.
Don't want him around my kids.

617
00:48:31.709 --> 00:48:34.377
Can't be held responsibles
if it carries on playing up.

618
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:39.181
Love thy neighbor, Chad,
that's one of the ten.

619
00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.151
I'll tell you an eleventh.

620
00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:43.552
It's one of me own
and I mean it.

621
00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:46.155
Stop whinging like a Fanny
about Gordon.

622
00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:48.224
The man's ill, got problems.

623
00:48:48.226 --> 00:48:50.259
I'm looking after him.

624
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:51.560
Leave it.

625
00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:55.598
You got something to tell me,
then, or what?

626
00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:05.207
Chored a small fortune
out of that house, Chad.

627
00:49:05.209 --> 00:49:06.575
I don't give a fuck, col.

628
00:49:06.577 --> 00:49:08.044
Not about any of it.

629
00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:10.846
Who the fuck
cares about clocks?

630
00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:13.015
I'm telling you, fuck this
country house malarkey.

631
00:49:13.017 --> 00:49:15.384
Not worth the cars, mush.

632
00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:17.386
The future's
in the intraweb, col.

633
00:49:17.388 --> 00:49:19.155
That's where it's all going.

634
00:49:19.157 --> 00:49:21.157
The wise world business.

635
00:49:21.159 --> 00:49:24.460
No son of mine is about to
start with any of that crap.

636
00:49:24.462 --> 00:49:25.561
What the fuck you know
about computers?

637
00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:26.996
You can't even read.

638
00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:30.466
Can't be plotting dreams
of another life now, son.

639
00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.636
Gonna come down hard on you.

640
00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:35.838
You killed trousers.

641
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.808
You just need to concentrate
on what's coming
down the road at you.

642
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:40.609
Kingdom fucking come,
if you ask me.

643
00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.979
Fuck all
to do with trousers, col.

644
00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.248
Poxy house was your idea.

645
00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.223
I gotta go back to bed.

646
00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.219
Chad.

647
00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:26.389
Chad!

648
00:50:26.391 --> 00:50:27.823
Where's the kids?

649
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.227
What do you mean?
They're at school.

650
00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.630
They never went to school, Chad.

651
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.768
- I took 'em there.
- You never.

652
00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:42.605
I fucking did, you know.
Ask me dad.

653
00:50:42.607 --> 00:50:44.306
Are you fucking joking me?

654
00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.743
Don't wind me up, Chad.
I've just been there.

655
00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:50.646
They ain't been at school
all fucking day!

656
00:50:50.648 --> 00:50:53.416
They're in enough trouble
as it is.
Come on, get up.

657
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.185
Little bastards.

658
00:50:58.355 --> 00:50:59.822
Little div.

659
00:50:59.824 --> 00:51:01.957
I'm gonna rip him up
when I see him.

660
00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:03.726
I tell you what, Kelly,
i fucking dropped them off.

661
00:51:03.728 --> 00:51:06.295
- You've gotta walk 'em in.
- I hadn't fucking slept.

662
00:51:06.297 --> 00:51:07.963
They'd better be with your dad.
I tell you what, Chad,

663
00:51:07.965 --> 00:51:09.765
they better fucking had be.

664
00:51:09.767 --> 00:51:12.334
I can't live like this no more.
Can't do it.
I've had enough.

665
00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:14.603
I've found us somewhere already.

666
00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:16.338
Everything's done.

667
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.874
- We stop up at Noah's.
- Since when?

668
00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:21.410
Does Colby know?

669
00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:24.146
Let's just find the kids.

670
00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:26.649
We can talk all of this later.

671
00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:31.153
You should have told me, Chad.

672
00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:32.955
I suppose if you ain't
told your dad,

673
00:51:32.957 --> 00:51:34.690
it don't count for shit anyway.

674
00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:01.817
Have you seen Colby?

675
00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:30.913
Seen Tyson? Mini?

676
00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:39.255
Walter, have you seen Colby?

677
00:52:39.257 --> 00:52:40.990
Yeah, he's gone down there
by the wagons, of course.

678
00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:45.561
Colby!

679
00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:48.631
Here he is. Look at this.
My son and heir!

680
00:52:48.633 --> 00:52:49.932
Your ears must be burning.

681
00:52:49.934 --> 00:52:53.869
- Are the kids here with you?
- You're my kid, Chad.

682
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:55.437
I'm not messing.
Are they here?

683
00:52:55.439 --> 00:52:56.839
They've been missing all day.

684
00:52:56.841 --> 00:52:58.841
They're kids.
That's what they do.

685
00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:01.243
I thought they were here
with you.

686
00:53:01.245 --> 00:53:03.779
Well, they ent.
Should be here.

687
00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:05.848
Sorry, but that's what happens
when you send them to school.

688
00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:07.750
Keep trying to tell you.
- I haven't got time for this.

689
00:53:07.752 --> 00:53:08.884
We gotta go find 'em.

690
00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:10.953
Just put a wager on, Chad.
Just getting good.

691
00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:43.412
<i> Can I ask where</i>
<i> the children's father is?</i>

692
00:54:43.414 --> 00:54:46.482
Please, I'm here
about my babbies.

693
00:54:46.484 --> 00:54:50.319
We're here to help you...
I hope you know that.

694
00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:53.422
But you need to help us now,
Kelly.

695
00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:57.826
You need to tell us
where your husband was
last night,

696
00:54:57.828 --> 00:55:00.729
and I promise that we will
make your life a lot easier--

697
00:55:00.731 --> 00:55:02.364
are you fucking joking me?

698
00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:04.733
No, I'm not fucking
joking you, Kelly.

699
00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:07.836
You need to help us
to help you.

700
00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:09.738
Not too late to get out,
you know.

701
00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.508
Before it all comes on top.

702
00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:16.578
Are your mum and dad
still not speaking to you?

703
00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.381
Well, you can talk to us.
You know that, don't you?

704
00:55:19.383 --> 00:55:21.784
And we'll take you straight
into protective custody,

705
00:55:21.786 --> 00:55:23.619
right now,
you and the kids.

706
00:55:23.621 --> 00:55:25.421
My babbies have been missing
12 hours

707
00:55:25.423 --> 00:55:27.489
and you want me to go gammy?

708
00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:30.059
Heartless bastards, ain't you?

709
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:33.295
No, no, we're not
heartless bastards, sweetheart.

710
00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.499
Actually, I've been thinking
about you all day,

711
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:39.034
as it happens.

712
00:55:39.036 --> 00:55:40.102
I've been thinking

713
00:55:40.104 --> 00:55:42.338
what is it like
being Kelly cutler?

714
00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:49.778
Sitting up there by yourself
every night
thinking, "where is he?

715
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.348
Is he coming home
or is tonight the night?"

716
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.282
Hmm?

717
00:55:53.284 --> 00:55:56.552
I mean, what does go
through your little brain

718
00:55:56.554 --> 00:55:58.220
when he's out thieving?

719
00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:04.093
Don't know
what you're on about.

720
00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:09.531
Please... my kids are missing.

721
00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:18.173
<i> It's Noah.</i>
<i> Leave a message if you want.</i>

722
00:56:18.175 --> 00:56:20.409
Noah, it's Chad.

723
00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:24.713
Give me a call back, mush...
On this number.

724
00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:36.992
We dropped them off at school
this morning.

725
00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:39.228
The headmistress said
they never went in.

726
00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:41.864
Yeah, well...

727
00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:43.866
...your kids have told us

728
00:56:43.868 --> 00:56:45.367
everything
we wanna know already.

729
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.872
They're here with us right now.

730
00:56:49.874 --> 00:56:52.574
Oh, thank god.

731
00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:54.376
Picked them up this morning.

732
00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:57.279
What, this morning?

733
00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:58.347
Mm-hmm.

734
00:56:58.349 --> 00:57:01.116
What, you fucking kidnapped
my kids and not told me?

735
00:57:01.118 --> 00:57:02.584
Shut your filthy gob.

736
00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:04.753
See, Chad's done us a favor
this time.

737
00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:06.655
Have you any idea
who he robbed last night?

738
00:57:06.657 --> 00:57:10.125
- I don't give a fuck.
- We will get him, Kelly.

739
00:57:10.127 --> 00:57:12.060
We will get your Chad,

740
00:57:12.062 --> 00:57:13.896
and you know it too.

741
00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.468
You'll never be able
to go coursing ever again.

742
00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:24.106
I'm never gonna
take you hunting, ever.

743
00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:27.209
Do you understand?

744
00:57:27.211 --> 00:57:28.911
You'll never be able
to ride the quad again.

745
00:57:28.913 --> 00:57:31.513
I'm getting rid of it,
smashing that bike up.

746
00:57:31.515 --> 00:57:33.315
I'm gonna give it to worzel.

747
00:57:33.317 --> 00:57:34.616
He's burning your bike tonight.

748
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:38.220
- Wanted to chore a dog.
- No more dogs, not for you.

749
00:57:38.222 --> 00:57:41.156
You took your sister
and then went and got arrested.

750
00:57:41.158 --> 00:57:43.926
You are in trouble forever.

751
00:57:43.928 --> 00:57:47.196
Do you understand?
In trouble forever.

752
00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.633
Me, I've never been arrested.

753
00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:53.435
Bloody have, Chad.
All the bloody time.

754
00:57:53.437 --> 00:57:54.736
No, I haven't.

755
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.972
I've never been charged.

756
00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:02.411
You, though, Ty, are in trouble
forever with them lot now.

757
00:58:02.413 --> 00:58:04.313
They'll be
out to get you now, Ty.

758
00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.915
Armed police.
Don't you fucking move.

759
00:58:39.917 --> 00:58:42.117
Over on your front,
nice and slow.

760
00:58:42.119 --> 00:58:44.186
- Do what they says, kids.
- - Get the fuck--

761
00:58:44.188 --> 00:58:45.888
Tyson.

762
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.222
Tyson, it's all right.

763
00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:50.692
- Don't you touch
my fucking kids.
- Get down! Don't move!

764
00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:52.160
- I want my dad!
- Get down!

765
00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:55.430
Stop pointing
that fucking thing at my kids!

766
00:58:57.468 --> 00:58:58.500
All right, mini!

767
00:58:58.502 --> 00:59:00.335
- Get him outside now.
- Fuck yourself.

768
00:59:00.337 --> 00:59:01.670
Where are your numbers?
-Shut your mouth.

769
00:59:01.672 --> 00:59:01.670
Come on.

770
00:59:01.672 --> 00:59:04.840
- Shoot me in front of
my own family?
- Get outside now!

771
00:59:04.842 --> 00:59:07.776
Where are your numbers?
Where are your numbers?

772
00:59:07.778 --> 00:59:09.845
Where are your numbers?

773
00:59:12.216 --> 00:59:14.082
Get your fucking hands off me!

774
00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:27.429
You got a warrant?

775
00:59:27.431 --> 00:59:29.097
My kids gotta go to school.

776
00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:30.499
Get down!

777
00:59:31.969 --> 00:59:34.403
Let me speak
to my fucking kids!

778
00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:37.306
It's all right, Ty.
It's all right, mini.

779
00:59:37.308 --> 00:59:40.842
It's all right, my babbies.
- Up, up, up, up.

780
00:59:40.844 --> 00:59:43.545
- Come on.
- You filthy pig dog gavvas.

781
00:59:43.547 --> 00:59:46.782
What you call policing, is it,
dramatizing my kids?

782
00:59:46.784 --> 00:59:49.751
- Get in.
- - I'm having you!

783
00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:53.355
I love you, Kelly!

784
00:59:53.357 --> 00:59:55.557
Love you, Ty, mini!

785
01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:12.608
Let's get these
wet trousers off, eh?

786
01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.877
Let's get 'em off.
Let's take 'em off.

787
01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:20.782
Wet trousers.
Put them over there.

788
01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:26.788
It's all right, mini.
It's all right.

789
01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:30.492
You did good, you know.
You did real good today.

790
01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.269
Never seen that money
in my life.

791
01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:15.871
You must have put it there.

792
01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:17.205
Grow up, Chad.

793
01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:20.142
It's not mine.

794
01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.613
Oh...

795
01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.684
Oh, I get it.

796
01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:32.954
That's funny.

797
01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:34.723
Is it Kelly's little stash?

798
01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.128
Oh, that cracks me up.

799
01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:45.067
You're all at it, aren't you?
'Course you are.

800
01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:51.139
It just makes me think
why, though, hm?

801
01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.476
Why's Kelly hiding money
from you?

802
01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.184
Money were mine, all right?

803
01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:03.985
Make your mind up, Chad.

804
01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:07.089
Poxy few grand.

805
01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:09.658
A man's allowed
to have a stash.

806
01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.060
If that's all you got me on,
I'm walking in no time.

807
01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.295
You're not going anywhere.

808
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.498
So you say you spent the whole
evening with your son,

809
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.966
Chad cutler.

810
01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:21.603
We have spent the whole of
every day of his life together.

811
01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:24.873
So, tell me, in as much detail
as you can...

812
01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:26.508
...what you did.

813
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.243
Told you already.

814
01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.446
After I'd given him a bath,

815
01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:33.315
I put his jimjams on him

816
01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:34.816
and read him a bedtime story

817
01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:37.519
about how fucking stupid
you lot are,

818
01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.054
and tucked him up in bed.

819
01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:41.823
Now, and this is
none of your fucking business,

820
01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.291
but as he were nodding off

821
01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:45.827
to travel at will
in his sleep...

822
01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:50.098
...i told him
that he were a fucking legend...

823
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.934
...and that he were
my son and heir...

824
01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.603
...and that I love him.

825
01:02:56.773 --> 01:03:00.609
I just... I can't
work this one out, though.

826
01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.812
A lord lieutenant, hm?

827
01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:07.883
It's a very odd choice,
given what he does.

828
01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:14.289
You did do your homework,
didn't you, Chad?

829
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.591
You do know
what a lord lieutenant is,

830
01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:17.993
don't you?

831
01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.563
Well...

832
01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:26.868
Well, Chad,
my friend, my little friend,

833
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:29.171
a lord lieutenant...

834
01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:31.139
...is the one up there...

835
01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.408
...who swears in
all the judges.

836
01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:38.446
Do you know
what that means, Chad?
Do you?

837
01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:40.015
It means

838
01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:42.818
that every single policeman,
magistrate,

839
01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.554
every traffic warden
in this county...

840
01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:48.757
...will not rest
until you're in jail.

841
01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.527
No, no, hear me out.

842
01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:55.030
Jesus died on the cross

843
01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:57.566
because of people like you.

844
01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:59.835
Well, I ain't
letting it happen again.

845
01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:02.737
Just 'cause one of his majesty
the queen's little chavvies

846
01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:05.807
wants to make me and my family
into the escape goats.

847
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:07.375
That's what it feels like.

848
01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:10.879
I feel like some stupid...
Some sac--

849
01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:13.281
no, sacrificial goat,
that's it.

850
01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:15.450
I feel like a sacrificial goat.

851
01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:18.820
Well, let me tell you,
them goats

852
01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:22.457
can kick, and bite,
and scream, and scratch,

853
01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:24.292
and poke your eyes out too,

854
01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:26.628
and they can start fires.

855
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.663
The horns are sharper
than yours.

856
01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.567
Them goats can turn
into super-goats.

857
01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.538
And you can lock
them super-goats up,

858
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.707
but what I have heard is this.

859
01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:42.043
Hell hath no fury
like a locked-up super-goat.

860
01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:50.185
You got no rights
to be keeping me here,

861
01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:51.386
no rights whatsoever.

862
01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:52.954
I've got every right.

863
01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:55.824
I know it was you, Chad.

864
01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.759
I know it was.

865
01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.669
"Your honor, I know it was him.

866
01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:09.404
You see, I just know."

867
01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.874
You're a dumb fuck, you are.

868
01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.544
You got nothing on me,
have you?

869
01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.616
Dumb, motherless fuck.

870
01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.954
Fuck off home
to look after your mutt.

871
01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.904
You gonna fucking charge me
or what?

872
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.607
Wait here.
I'll get you your scrilla.

873
01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.112
Don't worry, mate.
I'm not gonna do you.

874
01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:26.548
Where are you from anyway?
- Iraq.

875
01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.950
So you know what this is like,
then.

876
01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:31.319
All right, my little shithead?
All right?

877
01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:36.124
- Where's Ty?
- With granddad.

878
01:06:42.933 --> 01:06:45.266
Fucking nightmare, Chad.

879
01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:48.403
They've trashed everything,
taken all the animals.

880
01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:50.638
And Norman's been lalled.

881
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.273
Got any money, kel?

882
01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.476
Think you might have.

883
01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.780
Would have given it, you know.

884
01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:02.851
At least
i would have hided it better.

885
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.121
It's all right, kel.

886
01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:08.256
We're all
getting out of here now.

887
01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:10.125
Taking us all up to Noah's.

888
01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.628
Just pay the driver
and I'll make us a brew.

889
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:16.865
Get out the car.
Get out the fucking car.

890
01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:19.000
You got a ticket parking there?

891
01:07:19.002 --> 01:07:20.235
Huh?

892
01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:24.072
Huh?

893
01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:26.674
I'll chew your balls
and spit 'em out.

894
01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.176
Oi, worzel!

895
01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:32.180
Are you fucking deaf?
Huh? Deaf? Deaf?

896
01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:36.484
It's fuckin' 35 quid
to fucking park here.

897
01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:40.588
That's king cutler's plot!
Now, go on, fuck off!

898
01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.600
Where's all the dogs gone, Chad?

899
01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:54.269
Tyson loved my dogs.

900
01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:55.537
They ain't your dogs.

901
01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:59.107
I miss my dogs, Chad.
The dogs are my babbies.

902
01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:00.942
Shut up about the fucking dogs.

903
01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.845
Wearing my trousers?

904
01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:11.519
Where'd you get my boots?

905
01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:13.888
Where'd you get my boots,
you thieving little prick?

906
01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:17.459
Ah!

907
01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:19.661
Kenny, come here
and give us an hand!

908
01:08:19.663 --> 01:08:20.995
Fuck off, Kenny.

909
01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:23.431
Sorry, gummidge,
but I feels like hurtin' you.

910
01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:28.036
Get me one of the catapults.
Get me Colby's catapult!

911
01:08:28.038 --> 01:08:29.804
They all long gone, Chad,
long gone.

912
01:08:29.806 --> 01:08:31.473
Anything you fucking like, Ken.

913
01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.708
Shut up, Bennett.

914
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.743
You can have 'em back.

915
01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.245
Can't wear 'em now, eh?

916
01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.047
I don't want them. Ah!

917
01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.383
- Who's the fucking dog now?
- I am, Chad.

918
01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:44.686
Who's the doggy?
Come on, doggy.

919
01:08:44.688 --> 01:08:46.321
Come on, doggy.

920
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.923
Come on, doggy.

921
01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.493
What the fuck you want me
to do with that?

922
01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:53.528
I don't wanna kill him, mush.

923
01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.530
Pass that.

924
01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:57.198
- Who's the dog now?
- - I am, Chad.

925
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.433
Who's the dog now?
Who's the doggy now?

926
01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:00.201
I am, Chad. I'm the doggy.

927
01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.103
I'm the doggy, Chad.

928
01:09:02.105 --> 01:09:03.838
Rip him pants down.

929
01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.509
Hold that.

930
01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.858
What d'you say, then?

931
01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.439
Fuck you done, Chad?

932
01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:43.111
After everything,
you took it out on Gordon?

933
01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:44.779
No better than they are.

934
01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:51.052
Call yourself a cutler?
- Fuck being a cutler.

935
01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.353
Son.

936
01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:55.089
It's all right.

937
01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:58.393
It's all right.
It's all right now.

938
01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.596
I'm glad you're home.

939
01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.865
I'm glad you're home.

940
01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.703
Got a lot to talk about,
haven't we?

941
01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.741
Here's the truth.

942
01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:17.045
No one out there
loves you more...

943
01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.846
...than this man here.

944
01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.318
Hold that.

945
01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:27.689
Now, I were also thinking...

946
01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.959
...that when Jesus...

947
01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:33.127
...was being executed
by the police,

948
01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:34.662
he never did give up.

949
01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:38.032
Came back to life, didn't he?

950
01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:40.735
He came back
and he turned to his 12.

951
01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.504
You know what he said?

952
01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:45.506
He turned to his lot
and he said...

953
01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:48.509
..."travel."

954
01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:52.547
Stop laughing, Sampson.
I'm not joking.

955
01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:54.282
He said, "gel on."

956
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.018
Now, you hear this.

957
01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.853
Everyone out there,

958
01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:00.955
from his royal high-arse,

959
01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:03.725
mi5, cid...

960
01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:08.029
...they all wanna do us in now.

961
01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:10.131
They wanna kill the lot of us,

962
01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:11.799
kill our seed.

963
01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.569
But they ent beaten us yet.

964
01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:16.971
We're still together.

965
01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.742
Together we'll be strong,
ent it?

966
01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:25.713
It's gonna start raining down
on all of us pretty soon.

967
01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.548
Mark my words.

968
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:29.050
It's gonna come down hard.

969
01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:34.656
And they will break you
on your own, you know that.

970
01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.724
But not if we stay tight.

971
01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:42.196
That's why I say
let's fuck off to Kent,

972
01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:43.631
all of us.

973
01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:46.434
I'm not stopping in Kent.

974
01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:47.669
No fucking way.

975
01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.706
Travel and conquer, Chad.

976
01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.775
You go to Kent
if you want to, col.

977
01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.411
The kids have got school here

978
01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:58.112
and I got plans of me own.

979
01:11:58.114 --> 01:11:59.314
Come on.

980
01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:04.919
I'm telling you...
Travel and conquer.

981
01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:09.691
You'll see.

982
01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:56.637
All right, Chad?

983
01:12:57.573 --> 01:13:00.274
- Where's Noah?
- He's not here. He's out.

984
01:13:00.276 --> 01:13:02.110
Why don't he ever call me back?

985
01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:05.580
- Hallelujah. Say hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

986
01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:14.355
He feels bad, I feel bad,
but we had no choice.

987
01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:16.290
You spoke to Colby.

988
01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:18.593
Your dad was up here
same day you came.

989
01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.329
- Same day?
- Mm-hmm.

990
01:13:21.331 --> 01:13:23.164
He weren't having it.

991
01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:25.466
Threatened to burn the loft.

992
01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:27.001
Threatened that, Chad.

993
01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.774
Tell Noah thanks for nothing.

994
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.316
That's not so bad, eh?

995
01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.980
Colby!

996
01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.250
Colby, where the fuck are you?!

997
01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:22.323
You fucked me.
You fucked me.

998
01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:23.958
Could have murdered you
for less, Chad.

999
01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.693
I'm gonna fucking murder you.

1000
01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.234
See what you made me done now.

1001
01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:37.605
It's all over, Chad.

1002
01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:39.173
We're finished 'round here.

1003
01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:41.275
Fucking getting away from you,
col.

1004
01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.976
All right, birthday boy?

1005
01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:17.044
Happy birthday, Tyson!

1006
01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:18.813
Happy birthday, mush.

1007
01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:23.217
All right, my babby?

1008
01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:25.386
You can do
whatever you like today, Ty.

1009
01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.088
You can both
have the day off school.

1010
01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:28.656
They fucking cannot, Chad.

1011
01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:30.458
We've all gotta
go down there this morning.

1012
01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:31.893
What?

1013
01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.528
It's his birthday.

1014
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.296
Still gotta go to school
on your birthday.

1015
01:15:35.298 --> 01:15:37.865
Anyway, mrs crawley
wants to speak to us
about something.

1016
01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:41.669
Well, why don'ts
me and you get up

1017
01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:43.471
and have a go
at them rabbits first?

1018
01:15:43.473 --> 01:15:45.740
- You can drive, Ty.
- - Up you get, mush.

1019
01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:47.742
Fucking sleeping, all right?

1020
01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:52.346
Suit yourself,
you little maggot.

1021
01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:53.881
Fuck off.

1022
01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.852
I reckon, Kelly,
if I tickle him here--

1023
01:15:57.854 --> 01:15:59.353
fuck off!

1024
01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:10.464
Fucking doesn't matter,
does it, Ty?

1025
01:16:10.466 --> 01:16:11.832
It's all right.

1026
01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:13.267
It's all right, love.

1027
01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:29.717
Mr. cutler?

1028
01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:31.085
Hello.
I'm Diane crawley.

1029
01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:32.286
I'm Ty's class teacher.

1030
01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:34.455
I don't think
we've met properly.

1031
01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:36.791
Hello. Do you want
to come through, both of you?

1032
01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:44.999
So, um...

1033
01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:47.768
I'm sorry to have asked you
to come here this morning,

1034
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.136
but...

1035
01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:52.340
I felt that it was important
to talk to you in person

1036
01:16:52.342 --> 01:16:55.376
about the best interests
of Ty and mini.

1037
01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:58.813
I think they've made
tremendous progress here.

1038
01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:01.616
They're very happy here,
ain't they, Chad?

1039
01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:07.188
However, as...
As I think you know,

1040
01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:10.291
they have both
fallen considerably behind

1041
01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:12.693
the rest of their class.

1042
01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:16.797
Now, this is partly because of
their continued absences

1043
01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:19.333
which really go well beyond

1044
01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:21.469
what would normally
be acceptable.

1045
01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.538
Well, we are...
We are really sorry about that.

1046
01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.474
Things have been...

1047
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.579
Things have been...
Tough recently,

1048
01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:33.648
especially for the kids.

1049
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:37.251
Yes. What i--
what I'm trying to s--

1050
01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.688
Mr. and Mrs. cutler,

1051
01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:44.558
I don't think that Ty
and mini's best interests

1052
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.696
are served at churtle
primary school anymore.

1053
01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:52.566
I've really done everything
i can to keep them here,

1054
01:17:52.568 --> 01:17:55.336
but after recent events

1055
01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:59.974
it's been decided
that it's for the best.

1056
01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.813
Who says?

1057
01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.584
There have been
several complaints.

1058
01:18:10.586 --> 01:18:13.454
There are other schools
that I can refer you to

1059
01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.456
that might be better suited
to their needs.

1060
01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.992
There ain't nothing wrong
with my kids.

1061
01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:19.660
Mrs. cutler, please.

1062
01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:21.062
Chad.

1063
01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:23.898
This is a very small school

1064
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.501
and we rely on the support
of the local community.

1065
01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:29.470
No one has the right
to stop my kids

1066
01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:32.473
from learning an education,
no one.

1067
01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:35.409
Why? Cause of something
that has got nothing
to do with them!

1068
01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:38.079
No way! Fuck that!
- Mrs. cutler, please.

1069
01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:40.648
- Let's just get out of here.
- You fucking stay out of this.

1070
01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:46.821
Walk away, Chad.
That's it, you walk away.

1071
01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:49.156
This is your fucking fault,
you know that?

1072
01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:51.459
I wanted them an education, kel.

1073
01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:54.428
I wanted them one.
- Yeah...

1074
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:56.530
...so they wouldn't
turn out like you.

1075
01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:37.304
I thought I heard someone
out here.

1076
01:19:37.306 --> 01:19:39.740
- You must be Norman.
- Yeah, I'm Norman.

1077
01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:42.877
I got the money.

1078
01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:46.647
Right, well, come on in, lad.
Come in.

1079
01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.854
It was a litter of seven,

1080
01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:56.857
but there's just a bitch
and two males left now.

1081
01:19:56.859 --> 01:19:58.025
Lovely mother.

1082
01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:00.528
You're not from round here,
are you?

1083
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:01.929
No.

1084
01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:12.973
It's funny, I could have sworn
i recognize you from somewhere.

1085
01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:17.411
This one.

1086
01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:18.712
I'll have this one.

1087
01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:21.182
Right. Give him to me.

1088
01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:23.250
You just need to finish off
the paperwork.

1089
01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:24.852
It won't take long.

1090
01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:26.921
What's this?

1091
01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:29.356
Well, it's for
the pedigree license.

1092
01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:30.691
And for our records too.

1093
01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:32.059
We like to know
where they all end up.

1094
01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:33.594
You understand.

1095
01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:38.265
- I'm not sure about that.
- What do you mean, son?

1096
01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:43.103
Me hand written's terrible.
Could you write it for me?

1097
01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:46.707
I do know you, don't I?

1098
01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:51.745
Bloody hell. I'm not selling
my dogs to a bloody...

1099
01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:53.314
To a bloody what?

1100
01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.850
What were you gonna say?

1101
01:20:57.953 --> 01:20:59.854
I don't want any trouble, son.

1102
01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:02.089
Look, nor do I.

1103
01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:04.058
I just wanna buy a dog.

1104
01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.526
All right?

1105
01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:07.428
I've got the money.

1106
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:09.763
Go on.
It's for me son.

1107
01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:12.132
I can't do it.
It wouldn't be fair on...

1108
01:21:12.134 --> 01:21:14.001
On who? The dog?

1109
01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:16.136
What's that supposed to mean?

1110
01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:18.873
This is prejudices,
you know that?

1111
01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.574
I'll call the police.

1112
01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:22.810
Mavis.
Mavis, call the police.

1113
01:21:22.812 --> 01:21:24.111
There ain't no need
for that, right?

1114
01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:27.481
Fuck you.
You fucking gorgie cunt.

1115
01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:29.149
I don't want
your fucking gorgie dogs

1116
01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:32.653
out your fucking gorgie house.
Fuck off.

1117
01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:03.584
Keep the change, you cunt.

1118
01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:11.392
- Move.
- Excuse?

1119
01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:12.626
Move.

1120
01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:19.600
Come on, mush. Jump in.
I ain't gonna leave you
in this shithole.

1121
01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:22.202
Here, look after me juk.

1122
01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.843
I knew I shouldn't have
come with you again.

1123
01:22:29.845 --> 01:22:32.680
Stop flapping, jail, mate.
I'll pay you for the car.

1124
01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:49.496
Tell me, why you driving
through a field?

1125
01:22:49.498 --> 01:22:51.832
It's good,
a bit of cross-country.

1126
01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:53.567
Just for the views.

1127
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.937
You know, jammy,
if I could have done anything,

1128
01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:58.505
I would have been a painter.

1129
01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:01.108
You know, an artist.

1130
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.744
There's big money in art, mush.

1131
01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:12.119
It's my kid's birthday today,
you know.

1132
01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:14.221
Fucking seven years old.

1133
01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:16.023
Can't believe that.

1134
01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:17.358
It flies, don't it?

1135
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:19.860
You got kids, jail?

1136
01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:21.862
Hard, ent it?

1137
01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:25.366
To do all right by 'em,
teach 'em, you know.

1138
01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:30.738
Helicopter.

1139
01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:36.543
Fuck's sake, jammy.
It's me who's gonna be lalled.

1140
01:23:36.545 --> 01:23:38.278
You haven't done nothing wrong.

1141
01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:52.826
Listen, jammy, listen,
i need to use your phone.

1142
01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:16.216
What?

1143
01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:19.019
All right?

1144
01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.058
What you done that for?

1145
01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:28.429
Still your dad, ent I?

1146
01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:31.732
We'll be there.

1147
01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.288
Chad's been lalled.

1148
01:24:58.293 --> 01:24:59.893
He wants me to bring Tyson.

1149
01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:03.197
He's heading to the oak tree
by the old site.

1150
01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:06.733
Are you coming?

1151
01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:11.338
Dogs and cats, kel.

1152
01:25:15.044 --> 01:25:16.477
Tyson!

1153
01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:18.745
Ty!

1154
01:25:32.995 --> 01:25:35.863
- Cushty, mush.
- - Good luck, Chad.

1155
01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:10.631
- Have that!
- - Have that!

1156
01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.827
Charlie bravo, this is pc1267.

1157
01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:48.302
Suspect Richard cutler
is now up a tree.

1158
01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:49.536
<i> Roger that.</i>

1159
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:53.173
Yeah, we got him.

1160
01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:25.005
You make yourself comfortable
up there, Chad.

1161
01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:25.005
Have that.

1162
01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:31.778
Foxtrot Alpha requesting backup
for tree extraction.

1163
01:27:47.997 --> 01:27:49.796
Oh, for fuck...

1164
01:27:57.905 --> 01:27:59.606
Right, cutler, I'm warning you,

1165
01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:02.075
if any of you so much
as step out of this vehicle,

1166
01:28:02.077 --> 01:28:03.110
I promise you...

1167
01:28:03.112 --> 01:28:04.478
- Oi, Gordon...
- - Chad!

1168
01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.480
Gordon--
Gordon, get back in the car.

1169
01:28:06.482 --> 01:28:08.215
Gordon, you heard what
the officer said.

1170
01:28:08.217 --> 01:28:10.550
- Gordon. Cutler.
- ...Back in the car.

1171
01:28:10.552 --> 01:28:12.619
He's out of control.
I don't know
what to do with him.

1172
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:14.788
What's going on here?
He's not listening.

1173
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.490
- Cutler, get back.
- What's happenin'?

1174
01:28:16.492 --> 01:28:18.759
We're arresting him.
Aggravated trespass,

1175
01:28:18.761 --> 01:28:21.061
breaking and entering,
actual bodily harm,

1176
01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:23.363
theft of property.
The list goes on.

1177
01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:25.299
It's all over now,
so just fuck off.

1178
01:28:25.301 --> 01:28:27.100
Chad, what you doing up there?

1179
01:28:27.102 --> 01:28:28.769
I ain't coming down.

1180
01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:30.170
Fuck that.

1181
01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:32.572
Think I don't have
my own problems...

1182
01:28:32.574 --> 01:28:34.374
...without you playing
cat and dog with this lot?

1183
01:28:34.376 --> 01:28:35.842
What you doing?

1184
01:28:38.746 --> 01:28:39.946
Gordon.

1185
01:28:39.948 --> 01:28:42.115
Gordon!
Gordon, get back here!

1186
01:28:42.117 --> 01:28:44.451
- Fuck off, lovage!
- Gordon, don't be an idiot!

1187
01:28:44.453 --> 01:28:46.186
I am an idiot!

1188
01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:47.421
Get back! Fuck's sake!

1189
01:28:47.423 --> 01:28:49.790
Gordon, get back in the car!

1190
01:28:49.792 --> 01:28:51.124
Gordon!

1191
01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:53.927
For fuck's sake!

1192
01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.430
Boy's got a right
to climb a tree.

1193
01:28:57.832 --> 01:28:59.399
All right, you little maggot?

1194
01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.903
What sort of a man
puts a boy up in a tree now?

1195
01:29:02.905 --> 01:29:05.605
It's his dad,
for holy Trinity's sake.

1196
01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:13.013
I fucking love you, kel!

1197
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.016
Fucking love you, cutler.

1198
01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:17.417
Love you, mini.

1199
01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:22.856
That's it, Ty.

1200
01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:29.129
Nice one, Gordon.
Well done.

1201
01:29:29.131 --> 01:29:30.230
Thanks.

1202
01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:35.235
Think you dropped your hat.

1203
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.543
That's it.
That's my boy.

1204
01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:47.614
Should be having you,
you little cunt.

1205
01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:49.383
You knows I love you, Ty.

1206
01:29:50.419 --> 01:29:51.918
What's that?

1207
01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.887
Your birthday, innit, mush?

1208
01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:56.957
Come here.

1209
01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.328
Here.

1210
01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.632
Think of a name.

1211
01:30:05.634 --> 01:30:08.068
- Can't.
- Yeah, you can, Ty.

1212
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:10.537
- Fishes?
- Fishes?

1213
01:30:10.539 --> 01:30:12.372
What sort of name is that?

1214
01:30:12.374 --> 01:30:14.040
Fishes, dad.

1215
01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:18.178
All right, then,
we'll call him fishes.

1216
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:21.681
Not a very good name,
though, that, fishes.

1217
01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:23.617
You're gonna have to
look after him, now.

1218
01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:28.155
Mrs. crawley, she likes you.

1219
01:30:28.157 --> 01:30:29.489
Thinks you're
a fucking good 'un.

1220
01:30:29.491 --> 01:30:30.791
She said so.

1221
01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:38.965
Tell you summat, Ty,
i wish I did go to school.

1222
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.035
I really do.

1223
01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:49.609
Dad...

1224
01:30:49.611 --> 01:30:51.812
...is the world really flat?

1225
01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:56.950
I don't fucking know
is the truth, mush.

1226
01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.431
Gotta work this out
for yourself.

1227
01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.921
I'm not gonna see you
for a while.

1228
01:32:07.923 --> 01:32:09.689
I want you to be strong.

1229
01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:13.460
This is for you, okay?

1230
01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:18.532
You keep this.

1231
01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:22.135
Things are gonna
be different now, Ty.

1232
01:32:22.137 --> 01:32:23.637
You understand?

1233
01:32:23.639 --> 01:32:25.071
Yeah?

1234
01:32:25.073 --> 01:32:27.240
Look after your mammy...

1235
01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:29.276
...and do what she says.

1236
01:32:29.278 --> 01:32:30.944
And you look after your sister.

1237
01:32:30.946 --> 01:32:33.079
I'm relying on you now, Ty.

1238
01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:36.416
I always knew I could.

1239
01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:38.251
It's all right, Ty.

1240
01:32:38.253 --> 01:32:39.352
It's all right.

1241
01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:42.556
No crying,
not in front of them.

1242
01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.225
Look at me.

1243
01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.396
I'm sorry, Ty.

1244
01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.066
I love you so much.

1245
01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:56.136
You're gonna have to
be a man now.

1246
01:32:57.004 --> 01:32:58.338
You hear me?

1247
01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:03.577
You're the king now,
my son.

1248
01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:10.984
Now, Tyson...

1249
01:33:10.986 --> 01:33:12.686
...we're cutlers.

1250
01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:14.087
We gelling.

1251
01:33:15.389 --> 01:33:16.723
You ready?

1252
01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:19.859
You ready?

1253
01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:24.164
The gavvas can't think
they've beaten us, no way.

1254
01:33:24.166 --> 01:33:25.732
Don't be scared, mush.

1255
01:33:25.734 --> 01:33:28.969
I've got you, all right?
All right?

1256
01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:31.271
- We're gonna do this?
- Yeah.

1257
01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:34.975
On three, okay?

1258
01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:38.278
No, no!

1259
01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.180
One...

1260
01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:43.283
...two...

1261
01:33:45.387 --> 01:33:46.586
...three!
