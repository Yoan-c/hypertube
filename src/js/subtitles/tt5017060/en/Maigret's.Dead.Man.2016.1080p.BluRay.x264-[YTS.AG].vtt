00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.820
Is anyone inside?
Don't know, sir.

2
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.180
Come on.

3
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.620
Kitchen.

4
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140
Come out.

5
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
Come out!

6
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.660
Thank you.

7
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.580
Monsieur.

8
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.980
Come on, quick. Come on!

9
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.220
Hey.

10
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.660
Good afternoon.

11
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.220
What can I get you?
A token for the phone.

12
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.220
And to drink?
Er, whatever you want.

13
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.260
Um, a Suze citron.

14
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.580
Police Judiciaire. What department,
please?

15
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.540
Putting you through.

16
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.340
Maigret.

17
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.260
Look, you don't know my name
but you've met my wife, Nina.

18
00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.260
She says she's met you. Who is this? My name won't
mean anything to you, but they're going to kill me.

19
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.220
I've tried to come and see you
but they would've shot me. Who?

20
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.860
I don't know how many,
at least two.

21
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.540
And since the 2:20 they've been trying to get
me on my own so they can kill me. Help me.

22
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.540
Where are you? I tried to get a policeman
at the Place du Chatelet to arrest them,

23
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.120
but he couldn't see anyone.
They'd disappeared.

24
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.170
"I'm Nina's husband.
She says you've met her."

25
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.220
Nina who? I'm at the Cave du
Beaujolais. Oh, no.

26
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.260
Hello?

27
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.780
Hello?

28
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.500
"Yes, sir?" Get me
the Cave du Beaujolais. "Sir."

29
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.860
Janvier? Chief. Get down to the Cave du
Beaujolais, find the man who just rang here.

30
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.140
Should I bring him in? No, just talk
to him. Find out who he is.

31
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.540
"I'm afraid that number is engaged,
Inspector. I can't get through."

32
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.980
Righto. Phone, Chief. Says you know
him. Nina's husband.

33
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.340
He's here.

34
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.740
Where are you now? "They've swapped
over now, it's the big one.

35
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.460
I'm going to try and lead him to
the Canon de la Bastille.

36
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.860
Can you meet me there?
Do you know it?" Yes.

37
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.900
Who are these men?

38
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.740
I doubt that's him either.

39
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.340
Hoax?

40
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.300
There you are.
Ah. Do you want a drink? Mwah. Mwah.

41
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.640
Did you get a description?
"Fawn raincoat, mid-thirties,

42
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.900
small. He said he was the sort of
man you see a lot of."

43
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.660
Can you get word out to the city police that if a
man wearing a fawn raincoat has had an accident,

44
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.580
or been in a fight or anything like
that, they're to call me."

45
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.860
I've had a call from the Jours Heureux in the Rue
du Faubourg. They said a frightened, anxious man

46
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.040
approached the bar with a message
to ring you. It reads,

47
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.220
"I'll try and get to you,
they're blocking all the routes."

48
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.900
Come on.

49
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.540
And an envelope, please.

50
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.560
"..another farmhouse has been
attacked near the town of Goderville.

51
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.580
As with the burglaries on the 12th
of August and the 21st of September,

52
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.300
the perpetrators ransacked the
property and murdered the owner.

53
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.380
On this occasion, a farmhand was
also killed.

54
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.580
Police are following up reports of
unusual..."

55
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.140
"..if anyone has any information..."

56
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.540
"Police Judiciaire.
What department, please?"

57
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.620
"Hello."
Joe, it's Albert.

58
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.460
"Albert, what can I do for you?" Can
you come and meet me? "Sure. When?"

59
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.500
I've got an idea.
"Oh, yeah?"

60
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.860
Nina.

61
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.740
He said I'd met her.

62
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.620
Professionally?

63
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.580
There was a madam called Nina,
worked in the 18th.

64
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.540
But that was years ago.

65
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
She was 60 then.

66
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.420
The police in the Picardie farm
murders think someone got off

67
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.140
the Paris train at Goderville at 3:30 in
the morning. Having travelled from Paris?

68
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.060
That's what it says here.
Who'd take a route like that?

69
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.180
That train stops at every station
along the line.

70
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.300
Someone who really wanted to
get to Goderville.

71
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.300
Who's on tonight?
I am.

72
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.060
As far as you can tell, he was dead.

73
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.140
I can try.

74
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.860
That's fine with me.

75
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.980
Not a hoax.
Chief,

76
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.060
this gentleman saw the body
get thrown from the car.

77
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.420
Was he alive?
No.

78
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.540
He's been stabbed in the heart, sir.

79
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.740
What kind of car?

80
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.300
It was a cream and blue Citroen
with a Paris registration.

81
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.740
The last two numbers were
a seven and a five.

82
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.620
Thank you.

83
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.660
Can I ask you to confirm your name
and address, please? Of course.

84
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.500
Can you get some details from
this gentleman here? Sir.

85
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.540
Thank you for your help.

86
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.420
Who's done this?

87
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.980
It feels like an underworld job,
Chief.

88
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.020
A settling of scores.

89
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.180
Who is he? He had nothing in his pockets,
Chief, no wallet or anything.

90
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.340
Looking at how they've wrecked
his face,

91
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.620
I'm not sure even his own mother would
recognise him. That's how they do it.

92
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.300
Watch the chief. He's going to get
in the van with this one.

93
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.060
No, he won't.

94
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.420
He will.
This one's got under his skin.

95
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.420
I'll stay with him.

96
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.820
Thank you.

97
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.820
Do you have to smoke
while we're doing this? Hmm.

98
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.420
Antiseptic in the air.

99
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.220
Where did you qualify?

100
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.300
Is his suit handmade?

101
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.980
It's off-the-peg, average stuff.

102
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.420
He's poor all right,
or at least his childhood was.

103
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.240
How can you tell?
By looking at his teeth.

104
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.060
Where did you qualify?
What else, Paul?

105
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.300
His hands don't suggest
any particular occupation.

106
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.560
They're well-kept. He's got tender
feet though, with dropped arches,

107
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.820
They're well-kept. He's got tender
which indicates a life standing up.

108
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.580
Any scars on the body?
Any old wounds?

109
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.980
I don't think he's underworld,
Maigret.

110
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.460
Time of death?

111
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.220
Between eight and ten last night.
Well, good night, gentlemen.

112
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.220
What did they damage his face with?

113
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.180
Something heavy. Not fists.

114
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.140
After he died?
Yeah, that's right.

115
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.500
It was the knife that killed him
but...

116
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.140
..it's like he's been held down
and operated on.

117
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.180
The bruises on the arms,

118
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.340
this knife wound to the heart.
It's vicious, Maigret.

119
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.940
I'd like to get a mortician
to reconstruct his face,

120
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.300
see if we can get
a recognisable photograph.

121
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.180
All right. I'm going to open him up

122
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.220
and see what he last ate.

123
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.700
Those of a weak disposition
should look away.

124
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.420
We need to find the
cream-and-blue Citroen.

125
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.180
Janvier, take a man
and do nothing else. Hmm, Chief.

126
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.620
And I want witnesses from the bars
from which the dead man called.

127
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.700
Are people going to recognise him
from this? They might.

128
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.620
Those bars were
the Cave du Beaujolais,

129
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.980
the Canon de la Bastille,
and the Jours Heureux.

130
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.020
And we believe he tried to call the switchboard
from the post office in the Rue de Faubourg.

131
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.580
People are creatures of habit, so the same
time of day is when we'll get witnesses.

132
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.140
People are creatures of habit, so the His
last suspected location was the post office,

133
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.020
three hours before he died.

134
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.620
I want to know where he went after
that, why the phone calls stopped

135
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.700
and where he ate.

136
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.260
Well, he was killed shortly after
his last meal, which was...

137
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.020
cream cod, an apple,
and white wine to drink.

138
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.060
So we should check the menus of all
the cafes and bistros, all of them.

139
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.300
Thank you.

140
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.900
Fingerprints?
He's not known to us.

141
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.660
Your registration number is
1808 AD38?

142
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.820
Have we had any cream-and-blue
Citroens

143
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.300
reported missing in the last few
days? And can you tell...

144
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.460
He asked for an envelope and a stamp.
He posted it before he left.

145
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.140
Has the box been emptied since? Every three
hours. He posted it after he make a phonecall.

146
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.140
- Has the box been emptied since?
- Every three hours. He posted it

147
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.060
What have you got?

148
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.740
I have a cream-and-blue Citroen stolen eight days
ago, but its registration doesn't tally, so...

149
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.820
It's not our car.

150
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.260
What do you do when you get home,
Janvier?

151
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.180
I give my wife a kiss. Hmm.

152
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.740
When I get home
I get changed out of my suit jacket.

153
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.100
You think he went home
after calling you?

154
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.780
That would explain why the jacket
and the trousers don't match.

155
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.300
Moers, do you have a knife?

156
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.340
Yes, of course.

157
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.980
There we are.

158
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.180
Put the tip through here.

159
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.060
The two holes don't align. He wasn't
killed wearing his raincoat.

160
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.540
No, he was killed indoors
without the coat,

161
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
and they faked it to look outdoors.

162
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.380
All right, your dead man is
speaking to me at last, Maigret.

163
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.300
In the arch of his shoe

164
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.220
there's an odd sort of mud.

165
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.540
It's earth saturated with alcohol,
probably wine.

166
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.420
The type of soil
you find in a cellar

167
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.020
where a cask has been broached.

168
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.740
"Police in Picardie are still
working around the clock..."

169
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.900
I've said everything I saw,
gentlemen.

170
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.140
There's nothing else I can add.
"..on the slow train to Le Havre

171
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.220
on the night of 8th October,

172
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.060
the night of the third vicious
attack on a wealthy farmer.

173
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.720
The attack follows similar
burglaries and killings

174
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.700
on the nights of 21st September and
12th August.

175
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.100
The murders in each case
have been calculated.

176
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.060
Calls have been made to
the Police Judiciaire in Paris..."

177
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.300
What drink did the dead man order?
A Suze citron.

178
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.920
May I have a Suze citron?

179
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.220
And a token for the phone.

180
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.420
Where did he stand?
Just there.

181
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.540
Do you want a Suze citron?

182
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.540
No. Beer.

183
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:30.300
He said, "Since the 2:20 they've been
trying to get me alone and kill me."

184
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.900
What's the 2:20? A train?
Or a horse race. I don't know.

185
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.500
Oof.

186
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.660
Get his photo around
the train stations and race tracks,

187
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.020
and check on the times of trains
and races.

188
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.980
"And they're off."

189
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.060
"..slipping into stride at the tail of the field...
" Well?

190
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.540
Yeah, it's difficult to tell,

191
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.100
but if this is who I think it is,
you see him a lot.

192
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.860
Do you know his name?
No - but he's here every meeting.

193
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.260
Thank you.

194
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.540
Sir.

195
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.540
What's he doing?

196
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.940
Walking through the same areas
as Dead Man.

197
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.020
"..racing on the outside..."

198
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.220
Here you are.

199
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.140
This letter he posted,
was that to you?

200
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.980
No, nothing's arrived.

201
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.340
Then why hasn't his wife reported him
missing? Is she involved? I don't think so.

202
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.380
He didn't speak of her with any fear.

203
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.660
Drop it.

204
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.060
I don't think this is underworld,
sir. That's exactly what it is,

205
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.860
and we'll never find a thing. Let them kill
each other. I don't have resources for this.

206
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.860
We've just had a request from Picardie for
assistance with the farmhouse murders.

207
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.340
Make your entire department available to
Inspector Colombani and offer him your full,

208
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.620
personal assistance. Is that clear? I'd like
to keep this investigation going as well.

209
00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.340
He has got a link to Paris with this train journey,
and he'll need all our manpower and experience -

210
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.180
And he'll get it, but -
Good. File that.

211
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.020
Judge Comeliau, good to meet you.
Inspector Colombani.

212
00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.180
A good journey?
Yes, it was very quick.

213
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.500
Right, now let's get this down,
please?

214
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.540
If we can be careful.

215
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.220
Ah, good morning. Moers.
Colombani.

216
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.260
Morning. What have you got for me?
This chaise longue is from the living room

217
00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.500
of the farmhouse in Goderville
which was attacked two nights ago.

218
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.660
Is it possible you can tell me something about the
last people who sat on it? We can give it a try.

219
00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.100
I believe a number of people sat and
watched a woman being tortured and killed.

220
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.140
Can I interrupt?
Excuse me. Hmm.

221
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.520
Put it on the top.

222
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.220
Excuse me, sir.

223
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.380
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Chief Inspector. Colombani.

224
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.900
My whole department is at
your disposal. Thank you.

225
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.140
Except for Inspectors LaPointe
and Janvier

226
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.360
who are helping me with another
investigation for a few days.

227
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.580
Ah. Well, I was hoping that you
would be assisting me mainly.

228
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.860
As soon as I can, I will.

229
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.060
I'm sure you understand.
He wants them over there.

230
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.100
Yes.

231
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.580
I also want all the jewellers and
the silver merchants in Paris

232
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.580
checked out for items stolen from
the Picardie farmhouses.

233
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.420
Here's a list of
all the things taken.

234
00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.100
Check the fences, see if anything
connects to the murder victims,

235
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.780
and we need detectives on every
train travelling to Le Havre.

236
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.620
Your job is to find the man who got
off the train at Goderville

237
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.660
at 3:30 in the morning.

238
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.900
All right, so I've got
four witnesses at the track.

239
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.740
He saw the dead man laying bets on
the 2:20 the day before yesterday.

240
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.340
Very good. I have a sighting of a
cream-and-blue Citroen

241
00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.900
broken down here at
the Quai Henri IV at 8:10.

242
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.500
Now it was pointing in the direction
of the Pont d'Austerlitz.

243
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.420
The telegraph boy who saw it
was a bit of an enthusiast.

244
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.340
He reckons it was a Citroen Light
15 Traction Avant,

245
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.940
Parisian registration.

246
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.220
The chief says it's the best lead
we've got so far.

247
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.580
Also, the chief wants to know who he
was trying to call from the post...

248
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.420
..office...

249
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.180
..as there was, er,
no record of him

250
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.340
calling at that time.
What are you doing?

251
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:49.340
And where is Maigret? He's gone home
with a heavy cold, sir. Hmm.

252
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.420
Right, I'll be at my desk
for the rest of the day.

253
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.580
Hello, Maigrets.
"Judge Comeliau for Maigret."

254
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.620
Yes, of course.

255
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.980
Comeliau. Be nice.

256
00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.500
Hello.

257
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.260
Your men tell me
you're suffering from a heavy cold.

258
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.660
It's not heavy exactly, but I think
I should stay at home today.

259
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.040
I need you here. Colombani needs to trace the
man who bought the train ticket to Goderville

260
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.220
and to find out whether similar tickets were
bought before the other farms were attacked.

261
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.180
He has all my men are at his disposal. I asked you
not to work on that unidentified body. I'm not,

262
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.500
but I'm thinking about it...as
I cope with my cold.

263
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.540
Be here tomorrow.

264
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.020
And what are you thinking about
your dead man?

265
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.140
I'm thinking about why he drank a
low-alcohol drink like Suze citron.

266
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:53.580
And why did he? People who drink it
tend not to go into a bar to drink,

267
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.660
but go in a professional capacity,
like a salesman,

268
00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.860
who spends his day
being stood rounds.

269
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.340
So you think he was a commercial
traveller of some kind?

270
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.540
No, because of his shirt.

271
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.220
What was wrong with his shirt?
It was white.

272
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.260
It wasn't striped or coloured.

273
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.460
And the cuffs were not as worn
as the rest of the shirt.

274
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.220
What does that tell us?

275
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.420
Perhaps he was someone who spends his
days with his shirt sleeves rolled up.

276
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.980
Like a barman or a cafe owner.

277
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.800
Maybe he had one of those little
bistros run by a married couple

278
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.140
that only serve one dish of the day.
Yes. Are you warm enough?

279
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.060
Another blanket? No, thank you. I'll
put some more coal on the stove.

280
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.260
And I think I know
when he changed his plan.

281
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.460
What plan? They pursued him
from the racecourse,

282
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.500
and that's when he tried to phone me.

283
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.580
But after three attempts
he rang somebody else...

284
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.620
..from the post office.

285
00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.620
And then he went home,
ate his supper,

286
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.620
and waited for the second plan
to unfold.

287
00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.660
What was it?

288
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.260
I don't know.

289
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.500
If he went home and had supper...

290
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.220
Yes?..then maybe he was expecting
someone who was going to help him,

291
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.260
but that person didn't make it
until after his killers turned up.

292
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.060
Because their car broke down.

293
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.340
That's why the friend didn't make it.

294
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.460
If his friend was in the car,
why would he dump his body?

295
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.580
I thought you were too ill to work.

296
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.380
Get me Janvier.
"Yes, Chief."

297
00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.300
Get me Janvier.
Janvier?

298
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.140
It's the chief.

299
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.260
Chief? "Find out how long the
cream-and-blue Citroen's

300
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.140
been broken down at
the Quai Henri IV.

301
00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.500
And release details of the car
to the Press.

302
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.340
We want anyone who saw it
to come forward. Right away, Chief.

303
00:27:56.835 --> 00:27:59.700
I think by now all of France know
the dates of the murders

304
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.420
at the Picardie farmhouses.

305
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.260
August the 12th, September the 21st,
and three nights ago on October 8th.

306
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.180
I am appealing for people who
travelled on trains between

307
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.380
Picardie and Paris on those dates.
If you saw anything suspicious

308
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.340
around that time...

309
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.700
..please contract myself,
Chief Inspector Colombani,

310
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.740
Judge Comeliau,
or the Police Judiciaire.

311
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.980
Claire Fontaine?
You're not Chief Inspector Maigret.

312
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.540
No. He's not available right now -
I was hoping to speak to Maigret.

313
00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.700
If you sit and speak to me, I will relay
everything you say to the Chief Inspector.

314
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.460
If it's of importance.
But it is important,

315
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.580
that's why I need to speak to him.

316
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.340
I saw the cream-and-blue car.
The car that's in the paper?

317
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.940
The car that's in the paper.
This one.

318
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.180
And where did you see the car?

319
00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.900
In my house.

320
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.660
Well, I was in my house,
the car wasn't, that was outside.

321
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.580
I saw it pull up outside
Au Petit Albert.

322
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.020
And what is Au Petit Albert?
A little bistro,

323
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.060
run by a husband and wife
near where I live.

324
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.340
The wife stinks of garlic.

325
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.020
When did you see it?
Well, that's it.

326
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.500
Wednesday night,
the night in the paper.

327
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.140
And there was definitely a seven and
a five in the registration

328
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.540
because I have grandchildren of seven
and five.

329
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.340
Marianne's favourite colour - Did you
see anyone get out of the car?

330
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.580
Yes, I saw a gentleman.
Well, he wasn't really a gentleman,

331
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.660
he was rather big. What time did you
see the man arrive? Nine o'clock.

332
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.540
And where do you live?
Near the Quai de Charenton.

333
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.100
So the licence is held in the name
of Albert Rochain.

334
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.860
It's a quiet, respectable place.
It serves barges on the river.

335
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.300
And Nina?
Not on the licence.

336
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.780
The Fontaine woman says the wife is
dark skinned and a bit of a slattern.

337
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.300
I haven't heard that word in a while. When was
the last time you heard the word "slattern"?

338
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.300
I've never heard it. How did you get
out of working with Colombani?

339
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.740
We caught your cold.

340
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.220
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

341
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.700
Have you been inside?
No.

342
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.700
LaPointe?

343
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.020
Blood?
Mmm.

344
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.700
Nina?

345
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.900
Cream cod.

346
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.420
Well, they weren't after money.

347
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.100
Here's the jacket
that matches his trousers. Hmm.

348
00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.020
Do you recognise her?

349
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.860
No.
Do you think she's dead as well?

350
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.420
I don't know.

351
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.980
But circulate her name
and photograph.

352
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.500
Is there a child?
These things have never been used.

353
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.100
As if they're waiting for a child.

354
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.260
Can Moers get over here? He's coming
in his lunch break, Chief.

355
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.440
Colombani has brought in a sofa
from the Goderville farmhouse.

356
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.230
I've found the hairs from
three different dogs, from cats,

357
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:04.020
feathers from chickens, and fabric
from 25 different garments.

358
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.980
It's been impossible to get anything
useful from it.

359
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.500
Someone's been looking for
something here, Maigret.

360
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.020
I got that impression too. There are
fresh prints all over the bedroom

361
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.060
as if the drawers have been rifled.

362
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.460
What were they looking for?

363
00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.780
It can't be anything bulky.

364
00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.060
They even looked in a little box
used for earrings.

365
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.340
"Are you sure you're not going to
catch another cold?" No.

366
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.780
I've lit the stove
and I've got some medicine.

367
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.860
Are the sheets clean? There are some
sheets in the cupboard,

368
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.900
but I'm going to sleep on the settee.

369
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.420
Would you like to come round here
in the morning? Why?

370
00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.780
I think we should run this place
for a few days.

371
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.060
Us? Yes. I think it would confuse
the killers to see it open again.

372
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.580
"Might draw them to us."

373
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.140
Here we are.

374
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.180
Oh!

375
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.860
Now, have you been a good girl?

376
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.140
Mwah, mwah.

377
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.060
Who's running the bistro?
You told me he was dead.

378
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.140
Bistro?
Cabana.

379
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.940
Cabana. Who's in there?

380
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.300
Have you got the dope?

381
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.900
Come on! You told me
the little man was dead!

382
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.860
Of course he's dead.
So who is running the place?!

383
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.860
You tell the animal to
go back and kill the wife

384
00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.980
and kill whoever's running it!

385
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.340
Ow!
What if he told them what he saw?!

386
00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.860
Now, shh, shh!

387
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.300
No, no.

388
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.380
Dope.

389
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.180
You give them the dope.

390
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.540
Go back tomorrow,

391
00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.140
Pietr?

392
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.300
Find the ticket -
and kill anyone who's there.

393
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.980
Mmm...

394
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.100
Monsieur.

395
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.220
Thank you, thank you.

396
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.580
Did you enjoy the show?
I enjoyed you.

397
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.220
Where shall we go tonight?

398
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.180
I have a table booked at
the George V. Hmm.

399
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.300
Jean, can't we go somewhere
more intimate?

400
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.060
I know this really lovely little
bistro off the Saint-Sulpice.

401
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.020
We have to go to the George V.

402
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.780
Why?
Because you'll look out of place

403
00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.540
in a little bistro
on the Saint-Sulpice...

404
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.060
wearing this.
Oh, my God.

405
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.060
Jean, it's beautiful.
You're so generous.

406
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.300
Let's put it on.

407
00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.820
Adele?
What?

408
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.020
Look what Jean got me today.
Oh, are they real?

409
00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.060
Of course they are.
Ooh.

410
00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.900
Hmm...

411
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.260
The George V, please.

412
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.500
Two more coffees, please?

413
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.500
Albert Rochain was a waiter at
the Cadran for years.

414
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.180
He left 18 months ago to get married.
Did he meet Nina at theCadran?

415
00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.940
No. They thought she was some sort of
distant cousin, they never met her.

416
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.300
Find out where Albert's family
is from.

417
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.100
She may well be there.
Chief.

418
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.380
And I'd like to place an advert in
the personal columns.

419
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.540
All right.

420
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.140
"Friend of Albert
with the cream-and-blue Citroen,

421
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:19.100
for your safety's sake,
urgently contact Maigret at home,

422
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.020
132 Boulevard Richard-Lenoir.

423
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.740
Discretion assured."

424
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.460
Could you take this, please?

425
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.180
- Where's Little Albert?
- Where's he gone?

426
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.300
Oh, he's in the country for a while.
I hope he takes Nina with him.

427
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.980
Maybe we'll stink less of garlic
after we've eaten this.

428
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.640
Don't you like Nina?
She's all right.

429
00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.300
She's got a great arse, hasn't she?

430
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.220
Was she expecting a baby?

431
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.820
She's not. She's desperate though.

432
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.660
Ah.

433
00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.460
What can I get you?

434
00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.180
Another?

435
00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.140
Follow him.

436
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.500
Get the car.

437
00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.820
You'll have to take it back.

438
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.580
Easy.

439
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.780
Oi!
Oi!

440
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.740
Are we going to pick him up?
Just let him panic

441
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.780
and see where he leads us.

442
00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.420
Ooh.

443
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.660
Police! Police!
Oi!

444
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.260
What can I get you?

445
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.140
A beer.

446
00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.780
Oi!

447
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.140
Hey!

448
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.540
Turn around.

449
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.780
Someone's been shot.

450
00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.980
Oi, leave him alone!
Move away. Move away!

451
00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.140
Move away! What have you done
to him? Stay back, please!

452
00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.180
What are you doing here?

453
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.980
Police!

454
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.860
"You won't be home tonight?" No, but
I've sent a car to take you home.

455
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.460
It was nice being here with you,

456
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.020
playing at a different life.
I liked it.

457
00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.900
We wouldn't be happy doing anything
different. You wouldn't be.

458
00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.420
I have a feeling that
this was a happy home.

459
00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.460
Isn't ours?

460
00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.460
Yes, it is.

461
00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.980
"Yes, it is."

462
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.100
How did you know the wife?
I don't know.

463
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.260
"You didn't recognise her
from the photographs?" No.

464
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.700
Maigret will be attending.

465
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.860
You'll find her alive somewhere.
Have you locked the doors? I'll be all right.

466
00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.260
Keep the doors locked until the car
gets there. I'll be fine.

467
00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.980
Move along.

468
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.180
I'll see you in the morning.
"See you in the morning."

469
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.220
They're ready for you now, Chief.

470
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.820
Hello, George.
Home, is it, madam?

471
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.780
Yes, please.
Oh, it's bitter, isn't it?

472
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.380
The name on the ID card was
Victor Poliensky, a Czech national.

473
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.140
He was an illegal, the card forged.

474
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.980
He hasn't lived at his given address
or worked at Citroen,

475
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.620
his given place of employment,
for the last six months.

476
00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:07.260
Can you quieten down, please? Will
do. We know that he was an addict,

477
00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.140
and suspect the person he telephoned

478
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.900
was an accomplice that he tried to
get back to.

479
00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.780
Has this photo gone to Vice? None of
the girls recognised him, sir.

480
00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.280
And the knife you found on this
Poliensky,

481
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.580
is the one that killed
your cafe owner?

482
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.140
Moers has confirmed it. Albert
Rochain was not underworld, sir.

483
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.180
Yes, yes.

484
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.640
Now we will be supported by men from
the 2nd arrondissement

485
00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.550
who will search the area.
Everybody lock down a section

486
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.260
of two blocks here and are picking
up anyone that leaves.

487
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.140
We're going to find a lot of rubbish
and may not find his killer,

488
00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:46.140
but we need to find out where Poliensky
was heading and discover who shot him.

489
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.820
Follow me.
Up the stairs, second floor.

490
00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:37.740
Come on, open up
or I'll break the door down.

491
00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.780
Police! Open the door!

492
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.260
Do you know him?
Him? No, no.

493
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.340
Have you any Czechs living here?
We've got Poles, Italians,

494
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.100
and Armenians, but no Czechs.

495
00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.740
Argh! Agh!

496
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.300
I've done nothing wrong. Come on.

497
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.860
All right.
Check all the papers.

498
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.980
How can I give you
what I don't have?

499
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.460
Laurent, take the next floor.

500
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.060
Come on, mate.
Papers?

501
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.100
Right. Come on.

502
00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.780
Oi! You!

503
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.860
Stop!

504
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.100
Come on, you!

505
00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.340
Chief!

506
00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.580
This way.

507
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.380
Aagh! Aargh!

508
00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.420
Agh! Get off!

509
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.500
I just tried to make her get up
and she bit me. Look at that.

510
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:16.940
Is she Czech? I don't know, she won't
speak. She keeps moaning. Aaargh!

511
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.180
That's because she's in labour.
Get an ambulance.

512
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.700
Get the proprietor in here.
Sir.

513
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:29.180
What's your name?
Do you understand me? Aaarrgh!

514
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:31.420
Sir?

515
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.180
What's her name? Maria.
Maria what?

516
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.080
I don't think she has another name.

517
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.390
Where are the others?
What others?

518
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:42.700
There are no others.
So what is this?

519
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.460
And this?

520
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.140
And this?!

521
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.500
They've gone.
When?

522
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.380
Today. I don't know.
When today?

523
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.380
After this man was
shot in the street?

524
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:57.620
I asked him that already. He says he doesn't
know him. Did that man live in this room?

525
00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.260
Yes.
With another.

526
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.220
So there were two others?
I swear, I don't know anything.

527
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.460
You are very close to being closed
down. Please don't obstruct us.

528
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.580
They both...slept with her.

529
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.860
She was sort of their queen bee.

530
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.300
Aaagh! Aaagh!

531
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.180
Will you all step back, please?

532
00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.900
Just leave it.
I can't hear myself think.

533
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.940
Chief, shall I go with Janvier?

534
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:38.460
No. Go back to the quai, start processing everyone
we've picked up. Don't let it wait until the morning.

535
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.780
Find out what they know about
that woman and the Czechs.

536
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.900
Chief.

537
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.340
Pietr Holosko.

538
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:28.740
He was the most, um...
..possessive of her.

539
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.580
Was Pietr the gunman this afternoon?

540
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:36.500
He took the call but it was
the other man who went out.

541
00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.140
The other man?

542
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.500
A gent.

543
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.300
A fur coat.

544
00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.800
Violent.

545
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.860
How old?

546
00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.900
About 30, 35.

547
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.140
Did he sleep with her as well?

548
00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.180
Oh, yes.

549
00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.980
And sometimes...

550
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.500
..after he was here,

551
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.140
they'd go away for a night,

552
00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:15.180
and they'd come back
flush with cash.

553
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.420
Did they have a car?

554
00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.740
Well, they had a van parked up
somewhere, I don't know where.

555
00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.620
What dates did they go away?

556
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.700
I don't know.

557
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.860
Um...

558
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.860
October 8th,

559
00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.380
September...21st,

560
00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.860
um...

561
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.900
Go on.

562
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.420
August 12th.

563
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.100
Do you realise the significance
of those dates?

564
00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.620
Those are the dates
of the Picardie murders.

565
00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.660
Please...

566
00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.940
You've got to help me now because if
Pietr or the fur coat comes back,

567
00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.220
they are going to kill me.

568
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:41.420
I've seen blood on their clothes.

569
00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.540
They come back from those trips
with blood on their clothes.

570
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.380
The farms were so well chosen

571
00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.260
I thought the gang would be based
in Picardie.

572
00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.540
I thought they'd know the place like
the back of their hand. Maybe they do.

573
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:06.420
There are lots of temporary workers on
the farms in the summer, many immigrants.

574
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.380
Why did they kill your cafe owner,
Maigret?

575
00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.460
Was he in with them?

576
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.700
I don't think so.
So what did he know?

577
00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.180
Just what we all knew
from reading the papers.

578
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.760
That on the night of
the 8th of October,

579
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.220
a man travelled from Paris
to Goderville

580
00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.260
on the slow train to Le Havre,

581
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.140
a journey nobody makes.

582
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.260
You think the cafe owner was on that
train? He had no reason to be.

583
00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.540
But why weren't all four of them
on the train?

584
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:42.940
Because they had a van. I don't think
the man in the fur coat

585
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.100
would want to travel with this lot,
do you?

586
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:48.340
I think he'd want as little to do
with them as possible.

587
00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.380
Good night.
'Night, monsieur.

588
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.540
Maxim's.
We can't go to Maxim's.

589
00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.700
Why not? Because of what I'm wearing
under this coat.

590
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.180
Oh, what are you wearing
under this coat?

591
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.860
Nothing -

592
00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.900
except the necklace.

593
00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.620
Oh.

594
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.160
Hey!
The police have got Maria.

595
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.740
Jean. Stay there. Jean?
Stay there!

596
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.380
They picked her up this evening.
What are you coming to me for?

597
00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.500
I come to you. We need to help her.
No, we need to kill her.

598
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.540
If you hurt her, I will kill you.

599
00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.460
Think about it.

600
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:47.500
Think about it, boy,
she knows too much.

601
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.060
She's just a woman.
There are others.

602
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.220
Oh, no. He's under a lot of pressure
at work.

603
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:03.540
What, and you want a woman? Yeah?
Is that it? You want that?

604
00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.580
But not the old one?

605
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.620
You can have that.
Really?

606
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.460
And others, I guarantee it.
Maria is no longer useful

607
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.500
to either of us.

608
00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.940
No?
No.

609
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.300
Shut her up for me, Pietr.

610
00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.420
He's coming, he's coming.

611
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.340
Sorry about that.
Who was that?

612
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:54.180
I just needed to talk to him.

613
00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.260
How do you know him?

614
00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.100
He's just someone that's done
some work for me.

615
00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:23.260
Hello, Nicole. That you for coming
all the way from Goderville.

616
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.060
This is Chief Inspector Maigret.

617
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:32.580
Hello, Nicole.
It's fine, sweetheart.

618
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.700
Please, this way.

619
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.220
Nicole, it's very brave of you
to come and see us today.

620
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:56.660
Inspector Colombani tells me
that you saw the faces

621
00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.500
of some of the bad people

622
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.300
who came to your farmhouse
the other day.

623
01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.100
I have a photograph here of a woman,

624
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.620
and I'd like you to tell me if
she was one of those bad people.

625
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.220
Do you understand?

626
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.620
Do you want to hold my hand
while we turn the picture over?

627
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:49.460
Keep pushing.
Aaaargh! Push.

628
01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.980
And again.
Keep pushing.

629
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.180
Push.

630
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.740
Push!

631
01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.900
Here.

632
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.300
It's a girl.

633
01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.260
OK.

634
01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.380
Doctor!
Hey, let me.

635
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.060
Ask her her name.

636
01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.460
Ask her where she was on the nights of
August the 12th, September the 21st,

637
01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.660
Ask her where she was on the nights of August
the 12th, September the and October the 8th.

638
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.940
Translate that, please?
I'd rather not, actually.

639
01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.980
It wasn't very pleasant.

640
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:16.220
Ask her if on the evening of October the 8th, she
was in a farmhouse near Goderville in Picardie.

641
01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:20.200
Chief Inspector, whatever crime this
woman is suspected of,

642
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.180
she is a Czechoslovakian citizen and
has not only legal rights

643
01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.580
but an expectation of human dignity.

644
01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.580
I ask you to suspend questioning
until a time when...

645
01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.780
Do you want to continue with
your speech about human dignity?

646
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:42.380
Just translate for
the Chief Inspector, will you?

647
01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.540
On the night of August the 12th,
an old farmer and his wife

648
01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.380
were stabbed to death.

649
01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.180
On September the 21st,

650
01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.140
at an another wealthy, isolated farm
in Picardie...

651
01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.460
..there were similar murders.

652
01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.580
And five days ago,
at a farm in Goderville,

653
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:14.100
an entire family was hacked to death.

654
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.140
But at Goderville
a witness survived.

655
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.780
A ten-year-old girl
hid in a wardrobe.

656
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.060
At one point she crept out of
her hiding place.

657
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.700
And saw a pregnant, dark-haired woman

658
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.260
burning her mother's breasts with
a candle flame.

659
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:03.140
And after her mother had revealed
the location of the family safe...

660
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.740
..she slit her throat.

661
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.580
This morning the young girl
identified you...

662
01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:30.380
..as the woman who tortured
and murdered her mother.

663
01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.300
Do you think I care?

664
01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.260
Where is Pietr now?

665
01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.940
Tell her that her life may depend on
how she answers the next question.

666
01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.060
Where is the man who would visit you
and tell you which farms to attack?

667
01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.660
Please answer the question.

668
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.780
What is his name?

669
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:35.100
She has an hour to think about
answers to those questions,

670
01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.920
and to think about how,
in this country,

671
01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.740
we still send murderers
to the guillotine.

672
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.220
She needs to start co-operating.

673
01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.900
She has a child now.

674
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.340
Chief Inspector,
I would like to point out

675
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.820
that that woman is not Czech,
she is Slovak.

676
01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.540
Those people from the rural east,
they are uneducated.

677
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:23.340
Some are no better than peasants
from the Middle Ages.

678
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.140
No better than animals.

679
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.660
I feel I need to point that out
to you.

680
01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:42.060
If she's fit to move, Maigret, I want her
transferred this evening to La Sante.

681
01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.300
Excuse me?

682
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.300
Whose are those flowers?

683
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.980
Nobody's now. The lady in this room
went home a few minutes ago.

684
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.340
Would you mind taking them
to Room 270?

685
01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.660
Of course.

686
01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.780
Thank you.

687
01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.740
Why?

688
01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.900
Because the room is cold,

689
01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.020
and because there's
a woman with a child in there.

690
01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.740
Where is she going?

691
01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:36.420
La Sante's a prison infirmary.
She'll be well looked after.

692
01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.340
La Sante's a prison infirmary.

693
01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.620
May I travel with her?

694
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.780
Be my guest.

695
01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.460
No! Get back!

696
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.620
No! No! Pietr!

697
01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.780
Agh! Agh!

698
01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.740
Aargh!

699
01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:21.700
No!

700
01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.260
Who is he?

701
01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.620
He saw your notice in the newspaper.

702
01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.420
Oh.

703
01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:21.060
"Friend of Albert
with the cream-and-blue Citroen,

704
01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:25.780
for your safety's sake,
urgently contract Maigret at home,

705
01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.740
for your safety's sake,
discretion assured."

706
01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.220
Is that right?
Yes.

707
01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:34.220
I've come because your reputation
is good. This is not a trap.

708
01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.260
You can speak in confidence here.

709
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.180
Please, sit down.
No.

710
01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.580
I knew Albert. I ate at his place.

711
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.660
I knew him.

712
01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:55.220
And on the day he died?
He rang up.

713
01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.620
Said he'd been racing.

714
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.780
Said he'd realised who
the Picardie gang were.

715
01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.220
Said if we helped him,
he might get some money out of them.

716
01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.300
Who's "we"?
I'm not telling you that.

717
01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.260
But my mate does cars.

718
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.500
Paint jobs, ringers.

719
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.460
Anyway, the car we used to get to
Albert's place

720
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.780
broke down, didn't it? Pile of crap.

721
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.380
And when we got there he was dead.

722
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.300
The thing is,

723
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.140
the thing is I'm on parole.

724
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.220
I've been inside eight out of
the last ten years, Maigret.

725
01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.340
I ain't going back.

726
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:41.620
And you'd been seen in a place where a man was
murdered. That neighbour woman sawme, yeah.

727
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.540
I ain't going back inside. I can't.

728
01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.380
I understand.

729
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:52.380
And police don't take much interest if
a gangster's found dead in the street.

730
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.460
You don't sniff around that
for long.

731
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.980
So we dumped him
like he was an underworld hit.

732
01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:03.420
His face smashed in, like they do,
so no-one could trace the body.

733
01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.180
Then we got rid of the car.

734
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.180
Where's Nina?
She's safe.

735
01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.180
With someone I know out at Arpajon.

736
01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.380
She's a good woman.
Hmm.

737
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.780
Hmm.

738
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.820
Thank you.

739
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.740
One more thing.

740
01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:02.420
This envelope came for me the day
after. I think it's from him.

741
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.300
At first I thought it was a betting
ticket, but it's for a train.

742
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.220
How could Albert come by the
train ticket to Goderville?

743
01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.500
Francine?

744
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.960
Where are you going?
We're on in five. No.

745
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.270
Jean wants to meet.
We're leaving Paris.

746
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:06.580
What do you mean?
He's taking me away.

747
01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.620
He says to the Riviera.

748
01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.060
I don't have to do this any more.
Oh, Francine. What?

749
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:16.480
Do the show, darling.
Don't burn your boats here.

750
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.020
You'll be back. Jean won't want me
coming back here.

751
01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:23.340
He loves me.
Men like Jean come and go, babe.

752
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.900
No, you're wrong about him.
You're wrong.

753
01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:41.020
Come out.
No. I'm not coming out.

754
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:44.900
How often did the man in the fur coat
take them all to the racetrack?

755
01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:48.780
Oh... After each burglary,
that's all.

756
01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.220
They'd take the jewellery
they'd stolen.

757
01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:55.720
Silver cutlery and stuff.

758
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.910
That's where his fence is?

759
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:59.900
I honestly don't know,

760
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.780
but I know you can get rid of things.
Get your coat. Why? I'm not leaving!

761
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.540
Because there's a race meeting
and he knows we're closing in.

762
01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:10.260
I think he'll try to shift what he's got
left. What's that got to do with me?

763
01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.300
You're going to identify him for us.

764
01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.700
No.
Come on, get up, get up.

765
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.460
"The riders are on the track
and parading for race three,

766
01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.500
and they are led out by number
one...

767
01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.260
The next is the grey, Jolly Breeze,
ridden by..."

768
01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.820
We're looking for
a man in his thirties,

769
01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.940
possibly in a fur coat.
Will he be armed? He may be.

770
01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:38.100
If we get a positive identification,
let's isolate him before we move in.

771
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.460
I don't want him
shooting in this crowd.

772
01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.460
"..mounting a strong challenge on
the outside..." Let's hope so.

773
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.740
Go, ten!

774
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:57.820
"..it's a fifth win by..."

775
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.660
Look, that's him, on the stairs.

776
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.980
How much do you think I've won?

777
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.900
You go and get the winnings,
I'll see you in a bit.

778
01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.940
Where are you going?

779
01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.460
To get some more champagne.

780
01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:03.340
Excuse me? Excuse me, miss?
Yes?

781
01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:06.240
I'm Inspector LaPointe with
the Police Judiciaire.

782
01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.140
I wonder if you'd mind accompanying
me outside. Why?

783
01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:10.940
I'd rather explain outside.

784
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.420
My boyfriend is coming back with
champagne. He'll be joining us.

785
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.460
Come with me, please.

786
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.980
I want 10,000...for all of this.

787
01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.660
Get off! Let me go!

788
01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.300
No!

789
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.060
No! No! No!

790
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:47.780
Agh!

791
01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.420
No! No!

792
01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.360
No! No! No!

793
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.300
No! No!

794
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.500
Thank you very much for coming.

795
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.140
Your boyfriend's name is
Jean Tonnelier.

796
01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.740
He has a wife and three children,

797
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.420
and lives in a two-room tenement
in St Denis.

798
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.300
You may have just seen them.

799
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.980
Six months ago he was a foreman
on the shop floor at Citroen. No,

800
01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:36.020
that's not right.

801
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.980
Jean and I dine at Maxim's.

802
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:44.780
And we've had rooms at the George V.
The jewellery and coat

803
01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:48.100
I am wearing today are worth more
than you can make in a year.

804
01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.180
This man Tonnelier...
Dacourt.

805
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.260
..would get to know some of
the Czechs

806
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:03.780
who would turn up for casual work at
Citroen. He would manipulate them,

807
01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:06.380
sleep with their woman,

808
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.700
and he heard them
talk of the wealthy farms

809
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.740
that they'd worked on in the summer
in Picardie.

810
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.420
He is a film producer. He is a
ringleader of murderers and thieves.

811
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.340
He kept them high on dope

812
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.940
in conditions you wouldn't keep
an animal. No.

813
01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:27.900
He got them to murder and rob
the farms they knew in Picardie

814
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.860
in order to fund his life at Maxim's
and the George V. No.

815
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.620
And you.
No.

816
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:39.460
And he had a cafe owner called Albert
Rochain murdered because he thought

817
01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:43.220
Albert was about to expose him
for what he really was.

818
01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:49.380
How can a man sleep as calmly as Jean if
he has done the things you say he has?

819
01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.660
He is like many men,

820
01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.180
some who commit crimes
and some who don't,

821
01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.420
he lived a life where other people
were not people.

822
01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.780
They were just "things".

823
01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:12.900
And this is the file

824
01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:18.460
that contains details of what your
boyfriend and his accomplices did...

825
01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.460
..in order to steal the things that
you're wearing.

826
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:35.360
You'll be seeing more of me over
the next few weeks, Maigret. Indeed.

827
01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.660
The station master from Goderville
is on his way to identify Tonnelier,

828
01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.700
then we'll be transferring him.

829
01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:44.260
Did she know anything?

830
01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.620
No.

831
01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.660
Right.

832
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:30.260
Were you there
when they killed the man

833
01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.460
Were you there
who recognised you at the racetrack?

834
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.500
It puzzled me how he'd got hold of
your train ticket.

835
01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:45.260
But I think it was because he was
a compulsive gambler

836
01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.620
who checked the floor
for winning slips

837
01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.020
that had been discarded by accident.

838
01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:57.860
The papers that morning were full of
stories of a suspect who had taken

839
01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.420
an unusual train journey
to Goderville.

840
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:06.700
And when your victim
checked what you had dropped,

841
01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.740
he recognised the train ticket

842
01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.380
and realised who you were.

843
01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.940
Is that right?

844
01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:20.860
He was a nothing.

845
01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:25.700
A little man placing little bets
for little winnings.

846
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.980
I saw him pick up the ticket
and look at me,

847
01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.980
and so I set the animal on him.

848
01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.540
I want you to know

849
01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:44.620
that his name was Albert Rochain
and that he had a wife

850
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.260
and that they were
trying to start a family,

851
01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:52.300
and for all his little bets
and little winnings,

852
01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:57.020
his life was
more successful than yours...

853
01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.580
..because he didn't end up like
an animal in a cage,

854
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:05.220
despised by everyone,

855
01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.620
with nothing to look forward to

856
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.220
except his execution.

857
01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.740
I'm sorry,
I just have to finish up.

858
01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.640
My wife Louise.

859
01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.620
Hello.
Please?

860
01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:10.180
When is your husband's funeral?

861
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:11.940
Tomorrow.

862
01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:14.820
We'd very much like
to come and pay our respects.

863
01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:17.900
He'd like that. Thank you.

864
01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.540
I'm sorry about what happened to
Albert. He was a good man.

865
01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.380
And happy, you know?

866
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.820
He was always singing,
Chief Inspector.

867
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.580
He always wanted everyone
to be happy.

868
01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:45.820
That's why he was good at running
this place and...working in bars.

869
01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.580
And he was good to me.

870
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.500
I'm sure he was.

871
01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.780
I knew I was lucky when I found him.

872
01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:03.140
Will you keep the bistro on?
Absolutely.

873
01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.180
For him.

874
01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.540
We talked of filling the house
with children. I know.

875
01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.540
But we weren't so lucky there.

876
01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.660
Supposing you were able
to adopt a child?

877
01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.460
Do you think that I might?

878
01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:25.180
That they'd allow me?

879
01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:27.500
Would that be possible?

880
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.180
I know of one who is
facing a life in an orphanage.

881
01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.700
A baby?
Yes.

882
01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.740
One that very soon
will lose its mother.

883
01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.260
Maybe some good can
come of this, Nina.

884
01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.820
It's not its fault...

885
01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.100
..who its parents are, is it?

886
01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.140
No, it isn't.

887
01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.020
Do you think it would be possible?

888
01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:08.260
Let's see. I can ask.

889
01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:13.340
My husband would like it...

890
01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.260
if I was here with a child.

891
01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.620
Mmm.

892
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.420
Goodbye.

893
01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.820
Goodbye, Nina.

894
01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.100
Goodbye and good luck.

895
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.100
When Albert rang me
he said that you and I had met.

896
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.960
Yes.

897
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.620
When?

898
01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.980
Ten years ago.
I was working at a hotel in Dieppe.

899
01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:53.020
You were on holiday there.

900
01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:58.140
All the guests were watching you,
secretly talking about you.

901
01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:03.380
I took up some service for you both
one afternoon.

902
01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.980
Ah. Albert was very taken
that I'd met you.

903
01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.660
Will you ask about the baby for me?

904
01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:20.260
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
