1
00:01:44.483 --> 00:01:46.108
Yeah.

2
00:01:46.884 --> 00:01:49.192
Pretty hard to breathe, huh?

3
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:54.797
I mean, isn't there something
about the color white, like, uh...

4
00:01:54.877 --> 00:01:58.612
You know, like an art thing
or something? Oh, I forget.

5
00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:02.671
Like, uh, like it's the only color
you can't undo or something?

6
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.212
Oh, man, I don't even know
why we have to fucking repaint

7
00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.946
this fucking thing in the first place.
I mean, it was already white.

8
00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:11.425
They're paying us, that's why.

9
00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.238
Stop fucking around, man.

10
00:02:16.318 --> 00:02:20.612
- Now, I have to repaint this shit.
- Alright, man, whatever. Look, fix it.

11
00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.445
Why don't you get out of here, huh?

12
00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.984
- Get out of here, please, I'll finish it.
- Fine, man.

13
00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:00.350
Lizard King.

14
00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:04.071
My heroes are dead.

15
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.477
I was born in the wrong time.

16
00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.062
Fucking Lizard King.

17
00:05:20.142 --> 00:05:25.029
The same, the same, the same. The same.

18
00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:29.204
Fucking lamp is the same.

19
00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:33.437
Fucking TV, basketball, books.

20
00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:37.042
I don't hear. I don't see.

21
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.484
Oh, fuck. I shouldn't have done that.

22
00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:05.958
Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.

23
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.579
I miss the old New York...

24
00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:09.279
in, like, the '70s and '80s.

25
00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:13.079
CBGBs. The Ramones. "Mean Streets."

26
00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.946
SAMO doing graffiti
and Andy going to parties.

27
00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:20.946
The birth of hip-hop.
Just look at Times Square.

28
00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:24.654
Used to be cool... all cracked up.

29
00:08:24.734 --> 00:08:27.296
And now it's like fucking Disneyland.

30
00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:30.242
What the fuck happened here? Shit.

31
00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:48.375
That's a dope ride.

32
00:08:48.992 --> 00:08:52.645
I have nothing to lose, man.
Alright, fuck it. Fuck it.

33
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.710
Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

34
00:09:46.056 --> 00:09:49.403
The front doorman was there. I just
fucking jumped in and took off, you know?

35
00:09:49.483 --> 00:09:52.904
- But how did you start the car?
- The keys were in the car. I drove off.

36
00:09:52.984 --> 00:09:55.904
Do you mean to tell me
this really happened?

37
00:09:55.984 --> 00:09:59.438
- Pretty nice, huh?
- Well, nice, in a sort of

38
00:09:59.518 --> 00:10:03.911
kind of "Catcher In The Rye" way, but...

39
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.570
you didn't by any chance
bring the car here, did you?

40
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.340
Yeah, it's parked right outside.
Come on. Come here.

41
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.570
- There.
- Oh, you asshole!

42
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.420
Did you forget
that I'm a fucking dope dealer?

43
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.612
And I'm not the kind of person
who wants attention paid to him.

44
00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:24.051
I mean, you provide the community
with a valuable services.

45
00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:28.570
Yes, I know and I adore you too,
but it's time to leave.

46
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.987
Are you kicking me out?

47
00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:34.052
Yes, because anyway,
I don't think you can...

48
00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.580
There it is.

49
00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:43.154
- There you go.
- Prancy! I don't count the money.

50
00:10:43.234 --> 00:10:47.037
You must have robbed
a lot of people to get that.

51
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.496
- Are you alright?
- I'm okay.

52
00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:03.654
Look, if this is okay?

53
00:11:05.796 --> 00:11:09.695
Just, um, just give me a bindle
and we'll... call it even.

54
00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:12.503
- How much?
- A bindle.

55
00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:16.445
A bindle. Uh, considering
that you owe me $3000...

56
00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:18.479
- 3 grand?
- Well, yes.

57
00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:20.312
- Oh, come on.
- You owe me 600.

58
00:11:20.392 --> 00:11:23.196
- I gave you over 2 grand. Come on.
- 2400.

59
00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:26.743
- And that means you owe me 600 more.
- Juan, please.

60
00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:31.029
$600. Because I've been supporting
your habit for 4 months...

61
00:11:31.109 --> 00:11:34.312
Oh, Juan, come on! Juan.

62
00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:36.904
Please, look, I just need
a little bit of shit, that's all.

63
00:11:36.984 --> 00:11:41.812
- Think about the interest.
- You'll get it. Just a bit.

64
00:11:42.192 --> 00:11:46.529
Oh, well, Pranc.
Prancy honey, give him a balloon.

65
00:11:46.609 --> 00:11:50.134
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

66
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.025
- Thanks, Prancy.
- Don't call me Prancy.

67
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.850
And now...

68
00:11:58.442 --> 00:12:00.709
it's time for you to leave.

69
00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:10.937
Ah. That fucking kid.

70
00:12:11.017 --> 00:12:13.450
It's more like Catcher In The Rolls.

71
00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:24.695
Hey! Hey, Ruby!

72
00:12:24.775 --> 00:12:28.138
<i># I met you in a real dark place #</i>

73
00:12:28.218 --> 00:12:32.087
<i># But I don't know
if you're coming or going #</i>

74
00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:35.670

and we went to your place #</i>

75
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.529
<i># But I still don't know
if you're coming or going #</i>

76
00:12:39.609 --> 00:12:43.570

but it came and went #</i>

77
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.670
<i># I wake up everyday
You're just a memory #</i>

78
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.779
<i># I don't know if you're coming or going #</i>

79
00:12:51.859 --> 00:12:56.470

80
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.904
<i># She walk me... #</i>

81
00:12:57.984 --> 00:13:00.225
Hey, what's up?

82
00:13:00.675 --> 00:13:02.479
I'll take...

83
00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:05.612
You're gonna be like that, huh? Dissed.

84
00:13:05.692 --> 00:13:07.687
It's okay. It's okay.

85
00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:11.396
You know, I'm not like some
crazy, psycho, weirdo serial killer

86
00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:15.284
- who hears voices or anything, okay?
- Good for you. It's good.

87
00:13:15.364 --> 00:13:19.779
Yeah, my voices only tell me to hurt
myself so... you're in the clear.

88
00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:23.154
<i># I feel like saying
if you're coming or going... #</i>

89
00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:25.645
I was staring at you because, uh...

90
00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:28.155
I think you're beautiful.

91
00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.287
Stunning, actually. I mean...

92
00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:34.758
Seriously, you're like the fucking
hottest thing I've ever fucking seen.

93
00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:39.862
- Does this routine work on everybody?
- I don't know, I've never tried before.

94
00:13:39.942 --> 00:13:41.320
- Right.
- Yeah.

95
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.737
And judging by your reaction,
I'll never say it again. I promise.

96
00:13:44.817 --> 00:13:49.179
- Uh-oh, there it is. You laughed.
- I'm laughing at you.

97
00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:52.340
Doesn't matter. A laugh is a laugh.
Now you have to meet me.

98
00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.509
I'm Gus.

99
00:13:57.892 --> 00:14:01.414
- Hi, I'm Ruby.
- Ruby? Wow.

100
00:14:01.494 --> 00:14:05.487
Of course, that's your name.
Can I get... can I get you a drink?

101
00:14:05.567 --> 00:14:08.434
I buy my own drinks, motherfucker.

102
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:12.946
Thank you, guys. For this next song,
I'd like you to put all your technology away

103
00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:16.403
and turn off your brains for a second.
This song is very special.

104
00:14:16.483 --> 00:14:20.654
It's actually about a girl in the audience.
My girlfriend actually.

105
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:23.196
This song's called
"Nobody Knows Your Name."

106
00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:25.595
But I know your name, Ruby.

107
00:14:26.075 --> 00:14:27.941
Wow!

108
00:14:28.642 --> 00:14:32.100
Fuck. I should've known, huh?

109
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.742
Yo, Ruby!

110
00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:47.487
- Gus? What the fuck!
- Sick, right?

111
00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:51.362
- Yeah, but I mean, like, how?
- Oh, you let me worry about that. Hop in.

112
00:14:51.442 --> 00:14:54.562
- I can't. I'm going to the country.
- Uh, what country?

113
00:14:54.642 --> 00:14:56.622
Connecticut.
I'm on my way to Grand Central.

114
00:14:56.702 --> 00:14:59.529
Ah, fuck that. What, you'd rather
ride the train than ride with me?

115
00:14:59.609 --> 00:15:02.770
No, of course not, but what,
are you gonna drive me to the country?

116
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.690
- I'm going to Connecticut now, man.
- What?

117
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.504
- You're gonna drive me to Connecticut?
- Yeah.

118
00:15:20.384 --> 00:15:23.004
So are you really driving me
to Connecticut right now?

119
00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:25.579
Yeah. I mean, you know,
I've never stolen a car before

120
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:30.937
and I feel like the open road is good to,
like, I don't know, get away, you know?

121
00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:33.946
- Did you just say stolen a car?
- Yeah.

122
00:15:34.026 --> 00:15:36.403
I'm in a stolen fucking car right now?

123
00:15:36.483 --> 00:15:39.170
- Yeah.
- Gus, you're crazy.

124
00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:34.420
- Oh, stop, stop, stop.
- What, what, what?

125
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.812
Oh, no. Look.

126
00:16:36.892 --> 00:16:38.700
What?

127
00:16:43.192 --> 00:16:45.394
- Aw!
- Oh, man.

128
00:16:46.742 --> 00:16:48.711
Oh.

129
00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:50.784
I hate that.

130
00:16:52.084 --> 00:16:54.354
A deer shouldn't have to worry about cars.

131
00:16:54.434 --> 00:16:56.829
How's she supposed to know?

132
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:59.587
Do you think it's bad if I take a picture?

133
00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:01.654
I don't think it'll mind.

134
00:17:01.734 --> 00:17:05.533
No, I mean, like... is it disrespectful?

135
00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:24.700
So what do we do now?

136
00:17:49.483 --> 00:17:51.684
You're such a freak.

137
00:18:20.076 --> 00:18:23.929
- So how's your mom doing?
- So where are we going? Where are we going?

138
00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:25.812
Oh, we're going to my friend
Logan's house.

139
00:18:25.892 --> 00:18:28.204
Logan, Logan. Do I know that guy?

140
00:18:28.284 --> 00:18:32.779
Um, I don't know. You might've met him.
He's a musician. He's Cool. A little weird.

141
00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:35.545
Of course, of course.
Yeah, you and your musicians.

142
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:38.179
I only play the kazoo, so...

143
00:18:38.259 --> 00:18:40.396
- Well...
- I'm tattooing him.

144
00:18:40.476 --> 00:18:42.603
Uh-oh. That's trouble.

145
00:18:42.683 --> 00:18:45.712
Ah, it's this triangle
with all these treasures inside.

146
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:48.462
- Mm-hmm.
- So rad.

147
00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:52.212
- You're all about tattoos, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's my thing.

148
00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:54.654
It's like your passion.
You're lucky you have a passion.

149
00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:57.092
It's great you have a passion.

150
00:18:59.092 --> 00:19:01.279
When are you gonna let me do you?

151
00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:03.712
No way, forever scares me
too much, you know?

152
00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:07.787
Oh, God! Typical male, commitment phobic.

153
00:19:07.867 --> 00:19:10.312
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:19:10.392 --> 00:19:13.695
Hey, you still with that guy?
What's his name?

155
00:19:13.972 --> 00:19:16.758
- We broke up.
- Really?

156
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.975
I'm sorry to hear that.

157
00:19:20.418 --> 00:19:24.512
Whatever. I'm not. He was a dick. All men
are dicks. I'm gonna become a lesbian.

158
00:19:24.592 --> 00:19:28.029
I'd like to see that.
Seriously, I'd like to. Yeah.

159
00:19:30.934 --> 00:19:34.587
- So Ruby is single.
- Operation old maid in full effect.

160
00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:37.629
You know, I have to say I'm a little
upset you didn't call to tell me.

161
00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:41.329
- Gus, we are friends, that's it.
- Really?

162
00:19:41.809 --> 00:19:44.883
- Don't... Stop!
- Fuck!

163
00:19:50.483 --> 00:19:53.837
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine! I'm annoyed.

164
00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:55.895
Are you alright? Are you gonna die?

165
00:19:55.975 --> 00:19:57.670
- Okay.
- Are you gonna die?

166
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.400
Yeah, I'm fine. Ah!

167
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:08.725
Fuck, Gus!

168
00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:13.720
Now what are we gonna do?

169
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.973
Should we call a tow truck?

170
00:20:16.053 --> 00:20:20.542
You fucking crazy? We can't call in
a stolen car, it's a stolen car!

171
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.545
Did you not fucking hear me?
You can't call in a stolen car!

172
00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:27.338
I'm calling Logan.
Maybe somebody could pick us up.

173
00:20:27.418 --> 00:20:30.829
Okay. How many more miles on the MapQuest?

174
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:32.443
Fucking awesome. I don't have any service.

175
00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.570
Roughly. I think you saw it last.
How many miles...

176
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.670
It's far, Gus! Far, like 15 miles.

177
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.800
Fuck, okay.

178
00:20:40.209 --> 00:20:42.054
I...

179
00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:45.117
I guess we're walking.

180
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.695
I am not walking 15 miles.

181
00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.429
You know, you really are an asshole, Gus.

182
00:20:53.509 --> 00:20:57.198
- You could do anything and you don't.
- Yeah, I know. That's my problem, okay?

183
00:20:57.278 --> 00:20:59.503
- What?
- Yeah, I don't do anything, alright?

184
00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:04.338
Okay, no, no. Don't feel sorry for yourself.
I'm the one that's upset here.

185
00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:07.920
I should have just taken the train.
I never should have got in your car.

186
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.670
So you think we should
see other people then?

187
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.546
- You're such an asshole.
- So I've been told.

188
00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:20.612
Oh, Jesus, really? Ugh. Not again.

189
00:21:24.542 --> 00:21:26.296
Okay.

190
00:21:26.376 --> 00:21:28.325
You know what...

191
00:21:28.917 --> 00:21:31.079
Um... can you not die?

192
00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:34.645
Because I don't really wanna
be alone in the wilderness.

193
00:21:34.725 --> 00:21:38.445
You're afraid of being alone,
and I'm afraid of commitment.

194
00:21:38.525 --> 00:21:42.079
Okay, just don't try and talk.
Just try and not die.

195
00:21:44.425 --> 00:21:46.250
Okay?

196
00:21:47.017 --> 00:21:49.096
You alright?

197
00:21:49.576 --> 00:21:52.912
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm okay.

198
00:21:52.992 --> 00:21:56.029
Since when do you have asthma?
Did you have it as a kid?

199
00:21:56.109 --> 00:22:00.267
I don't know, I hurt my neck recently.
Maybe that's why. I don't know.

200
00:22:03.034 --> 00:22:06.979
- How many more miles?
- Like 12. At least 12 miles.

201
00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:09.046
12 miles.

202
00:22:09.126 --> 00:22:12.420
That's smart. That seems like a really
smart thing to do for your asthma.

203
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.792
Yeah, fuck off.

204
00:22:47.425 --> 00:22:50.442
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

205
00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:53.445
- Going for a swim.
- You're crazy!

206
00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:55.587
- Yeah, so?
- You're not going for a swim.

207
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:58.414
Yeah, I am. You gonna come?

208
00:22:58.494 --> 00:23:02.229
- Absolutely not. I'm not going for a swim.
- Oh, come on, it'll be romantic.

209
00:23:02.309 --> 00:23:05.171
Oh, "It'll be romantic,"
he says as he takes off his pants.

210
00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:07.795
- Yeah. Come on!
- No way.

211
00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:10.812
- Are you sure?
- I am not swimming.

212
00:23:10.892 --> 00:23:14.709
- Oh, my God. Gus, you're crazy!
- Oh, my God!

213
00:23:17.575 --> 00:23:20.379
- Come on! Come in!
- It's too much romance for me.

214
00:23:20.459 --> 00:23:23.258
- Oh, my God. You coming in or what?
- I told you I'm not swimming.

215
00:23:23.338 --> 00:23:26.904
Good, it's fucking freezing. Oh, my God!

216
00:23:26.984 --> 00:23:30.071
Hey, at least get that blood off your face.
You look like a maniac.

217
00:23:30.151 --> 00:23:31.983
Okay.

218
00:23:33.717 --> 00:23:35.779
- Gone?
- It's gone, you're good.

219
00:23:35.859 --> 00:23:37.420
- Alright, give me your jacket.
- No way!

220
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.770
- Give me your fucking jacket.
- I'm not giving you my jacket!

221
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.571
Give me your fucking jacket.
Are you crazy?

222
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:43.138
I'm gonna need...

223
00:23:43.218 --> 00:23:45.850
- Give me your fuckin jacket!
- No!

224
00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:53.067
Come on. Yeah.

225
00:23:57.017 --> 00:23:59.284
Now, come on.

226
00:24:01.683 --> 00:24:04.219
- Gus?
- Oh, yeah.

227
00:24:10.467 --> 00:24:12.676
Gus, what are you doing?

228
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.795
- What the fuck, Gus?
- Whatever happened to privacy, huh?

229
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.670
What the fuck are you doing?
Is that heroin?

230
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.204
No, it's a turkey sandwich.

231
00:24:23.284 --> 00:24:27.125
- What are you gonna do with that?
- I'm gonna eat it. What do you think?

232
00:24:30.576 --> 00:24:34.625
- You're on heroin, Gus?
- Yeah, from time to time.

233
00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:38.445
You're gonna fucking shoot heroin
in front of me?

234
00:24:38.525 --> 00:24:40.987
There's a whole fucking forest around.
What do you fucking care?

235
00:24:41.067 --> 00:24:44.700
You put needles in your arm all the time?
What's the fucking difference, okay?

236
00:25:03.992 --> 00:25:07.558
Come here. Hey, hey, come here.

237
00:25:10.267 --> 00:25:12.108
Come on.

238
00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:26.842
- You okay?
- Yeah.

239
00:25:50.542 --> 00:25:54.782
- What's it feel like?
- You're fucking amazing.

240
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.671
Whoa!

241
00:26:20.251 --> 00:26:23.604
That's a serious fucking werewolf.

242
00:26:23.984 --> 00:26:26.200
What does it mean?

243
00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:29.995
I don't like talking about
the meaning or whatever.

244
00:26:30.075 --> 00:26:31.929
Okay.

245
00:26:32.209 --> 00:26:35.837
- It's scary that werewolf.
- I like that.

246
00:26:35.917 --> 00:26:38.129
- I like that it's scary to people.
- Yeah.

247
00:26:38.209 --> 00:26:42.462
But for me, it's like a guardian angel
or a guard dog or some shit.

248
00:26:42.542 --> 00:26:45.292
You're too gangster for me, huh?

249
00:27:10.917 --> 00:27:13.479
- Do you have a condom?
- What?

250
00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:16.438
- Do you have a condom?
- Fuck no.

251
00:27:16.518 --> 00:27:20.711
You... you thought... you thought
I'd think this would happen?

252
00:27:21.126 --> 00:27:23.350
So what do we do then?

253
00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:28.049
I know what I think we should do.

254
00:28:42.309 --> 00:28:44.558
Are you kidding me?

255
00:28:45.376 --> 00:28:47.050
Gus?

256
00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:53.367
Gus!

257
00:28:56.883 --> 00:28:58.717
Gus!

258
00:29:01.834 --> 00:29:03.438
Gus!

259
00:29:03.518 --> 00:29:05.603
- Yeah!
- Hey, where are you?

260
00:29:05.683 --> 00:29:08.171
Jesus Christ! Where do you think I'd be?

261
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:10.841
I'm taking a shit, okay?

262
00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:14.000
So chill!

263
00:29:14.542 --> 00:29:16.945
What about toilet paper?

264
00:29:17.825 --> 00:29:20.709
- I'm using a fucking leaf!
- Ew!

265
00:29:24.184 --> 00:29:26.503
Okay, how much longer, please.

266
00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:30.350
- I don't know. My phone died.
- Oh, fuck!

267
00:29:31.276 --> 00:29:32.837
You remember how to get there?

268
00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:36.438
- Uh, let's fucking hope so.
- Well, do you know the way?

269
00:29:36.518 --> 00:29:40.350
No, I don't know.
I've never been there by foot.

270
00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:44.582
Okay. Shit. Uh, how much longer, please?

271
00:29:44.662 --> 00:29:47.503
- Mommy, are we there yet?
- Shut up!

272
00:29:47.583 --> 00:29:50.772
- Just shut up.
- I don't know. I don't know, like...

273
00:29:50.852 --> 00:29:53.933
- a couple of hours, 5 miles?
- Couple of hours?

274
00:29:59.659 --> 00:30:02.329
- Hey, we did it last night, right?
- Shut up!

275
00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:05.979
- Was I good?
- Seriously, Gus, that was a one time thing.

276
00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:08.687
We're friends.
Don't go falling in love with me.

277
00:30:08.767 --> 00:30:11.582
- Yeah, you wish.
- And don't tell anyone.

278
00:30:11.662 --> 00:30:13.867
Who am I gonna tell?

279
00:30:15.451 --> 00:30:17.992
But seriously though, good, right?

280
00:30:21.534 --> 00:30:23.325
Huh?

281
00:30:25.592 --> 00:30:27.384
- Which way? Left or right?
- I don't know. Left.

282
00:30:27.464 --> 00:30:29.187
Left?

283
00:30:32.542 --> 00:30:35.171
Dude, can you wait up for me, please?
I've rocks in my shoes.

284
00:30:35.251 --> 00:30:37.529
You've rocks in your fucking head.

285
00:30:37.609 --> 00:30:40.312
That was a really funny joke, Gus.

286
00:30:40.392 --> 00:30:42.817
Seriously, wait for me.

287
00:30:52.834 --> 00:30:55.837
- Oh, you know what?
- What? What, is this it?

288
00:30:55.917 --> 00:30:58.654
- It looks like my friend's car. I think so.
- Alright. Thank God.

289
00:30:58.734 --> 00:31:02.841
I don't know if I believe in God
but probably, we made it here, so yeah.

290
00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:07.154
<i># Oh, my #</i>

291
00:31:07.234 --> 00:31:12.296
<i># Primordial mind... #</i>

292
00:31:13.276 --> 00:31:14.962
This was happening
literally during that time.

293
00:31:15.042 --> 00:31:16.962
- I know that moment.
- You do know that moment?

294
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:19.101
I know that moment in life, yeah.

295
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:22.429
- I love that you're capturing my wings.
- Yeah.

296
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:24.695
I always imagined myself with wings.

297
00:31:24.775 --> 00:31:27.046
You totally seem like
you could fly out of the tub.

298
00:31:27.126 --> 00:31:28.920
I know.

299
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.487
- What's this one all about?
- That's from an old French movie.

300
00:31:32.567 --> 00:31:34.569
- Parisian? That looks old.
- Yeah.

301
00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:37.645
Do you know anyone
who can get us some drugs?

302
00:31:37.725 --> 00:31:40.729
Yes, well, the closest guy,
oh, my God, you have to meet him,

303
00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:44.143
he lives in a tree house
that he built right by here.

304
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:03.279
- Yeah, I dropped out of high school at 16.
- Nice.

305
00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:05.712
- I did music full time.
- Wow!

306
00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:07.720
- I fucking know that guy.
- You... you know him?

307
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.937
Not personally. He's the fucking
lead singer of The Other Days.

308
00:32:10.017 --> 00:32:14.254
- Why didn't you say something to me?
- I told you that he was a musician.

309
00:32:14.334 --> 00:32:16.503
- Are you gonna be alright?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:32:16.583 --> 00:32:19.633
- Logan!
- It's good.

311
00:32:21.376 --> 00:32:23.597
- Oh, my God. Is he coming?
- Logan!

312
00:32:23.677 --> 00:32:25.187
Ruby!

313
00:32:25.267 --> 00:32:28.600
Hey! Oh, my God.

314
00:32:29.425 --> 00:32:32.045
Thank you so much for coming.

315
00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:34.712
- How are you?
- You have no idea.

316
00:32:34.792 --> 00:32:37.554
We got in a car crash,
and we had to walk here.

317
00:32:37.634 --> 00:32:40.775
- You got in a car crash?
- Yeah.

318
00:32:40.855 --> 00:32:43.670
- Are you okay?
- We literally had to walk 15 miles.

319
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.379
You walked for 15... Why didn't
you call me? You should've...

320
00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:49.858
- I didn't have any cell phone service.
- The car was stolen, so...

321
00:32:50.126 --> 00:32:51.479
Sorry, what, you stole a car?

322
00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:54.143
- I didn't steal the car, just to be clear.
- I stole the car.

323
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:56.396
I had nothing to do with it.
Just to clarify.

324
00:32:56.476 --> 00:33:00.196
- Okay, that's okay. Hello.
- Sorry, this is my friend Gus.

325
00:33:00.276 --> 00:33:04.087
Hey, man, I have to say I fucking love
your music, man. That was like...

326
00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:07.012
When I was growing up,
it was the soundtrack to my life.

327
00:33:07.092 --> 00:33:11.787
Thank you. Thanks, man.
Wow, I feel so old now.

328
00:33:11.867 --> 00:33:13.246
- Sorry.
- I'm freezing.

329
00:33:13.326 --> 00:33:16.420
I'm gonna get back in,
but, um, yeah, help yourself.

330
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.587
There's food over there,
and there's drinks.

331
00:33:20.167 --> 00:33:21.833
- I'm really happy to see you.
- Yeah.

332
00:33:21.913 --> 00:33:24.487
And meet you. You look like Mick Jagger.

333
00:33:24.567 --> 00:33:27.274
- I like you, man.
- I like you.

334
00:33:27.354 --> 00:33:31.387
You're her car thief. It's like
real life "Grand Theft Auto" here.

335
00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:33.754
- Peace. We'll catch you up in a bit.
- Amazing.

336
00:33:33.834 --> 00:33:36.669
Alright, that was embarrassing.
What's the matter with you?

337
00:33:36.749 --> 00:33:38.995
Nothing, man.

338
00:33:44.267 --> 00:33:46.254
I'm good.

339
00:33:46.334 --> 00:33:49.592
Oh, yeah. No, I... I lost my phone.

340
00:33:50.642 --> 00:33:52.662
I told you, Dad's a fucking asshole.

341
00:33:52.742 --> 00:33:55.929
That's not your problem.
You got enough to worry about as it is.

342
00:33:56.009 --> 00:33:59.129
Well, I'm... I'm in Connecticut, yeah.

343
00:33:59.209 --> 00:34:02.276
I don't know, just...
just a spur of the moment thing.

344
00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:05.517
I'm at a friend's place.

345
00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:08.754
No, you don't know her.

346
00:34:08.834 --> 00:34:11.403
Her name's Ruby, Ma.

347
00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.290
She's just a friend.

348
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.695
Yeah.

349
00:34:16.975 --> 00:34:20.150
No, I'll probably stay here tonight.

350
00:34:29.309 --> 00:34:33.117
Hey, Ka, I, uh...
can't really talk right now.

351
00:34:34.084 --> 00:34:35.903
Okay?

352
00:34:36.483 --> 00:34:38.999
Yeah, I love you too. Alright, bye.

353
00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:47.483
What a dick.

354
00:34:47.609 --> 00:34:51.842
So what do you do?
If you don't mind my asking.

355
00:34:52.267 --> 00:34:54.079
Um...

356
00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.092
I work at Taco Bell.

357
00:34:57.867 --> 00:35:00.087
- He's an actor.
- No, I quit acting. I quit acting.

358
00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:03.238
- He doesn't work at Taco Bell.
- That's true, I don't,

359
00:35:03.318 --> 00:35:06.087
but the tacos, when you're fucked up,
you know, there ain't nothing better.

360
00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:07.662
Oh, my God, I love Taco Bell.

361
00:35:07.742 --> 00:35:11.872
Then what the fuck
with all this tofu crap, man? Fuck.

362
00:35:12.092 --> 00:35:13.895
There's no need to be so aggressive.

363
00:35:13.975 --> 00:35:17.112
I'm sorry, I apologize for my friend.
He's had kind of a rough 48 hours.

364
00:35:17.192 --> 00:35:19.646
Oh, I really love that show.

365
00:35:20.126 --> 00:35:23.169
"The First 48 Hours," you know...

366
00:35:23.649 --> 00:35:27.357
When they... there's, like, a criminal
that they're trying to track down

367
00:35:27.437 --> 00:35:31.820
for murders and what not.
It's really good, they...

368
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.729
People always kinda
give up though, it's...

369
00:35:35.209 --> 00:35:36.379
You know...

370
00:35:36.459 --> 00:35:38.912
Thank you for sharing, Bottlecap.

371
00:35:38.992 --> 00:35:41.429
You come to a neighbor's house...

372
00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:45.870
and they're kind enough to cook
a fine meal for you and what do you do?

373
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.617
You insult it. You insult us.

374
00:35:51.376 --> 00:35:54.450
You're probably thinking
I'm gonna come after you now, right?

375
00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:59.046
Probably worried I'm gonna
jump across the fire pit

376
00:35:59.126 --> 00:36:02.867
and stab you in the neck
with a... fork, right?

377
00:36:07.276 --> 00:36:10.267
Well, wrong. You know why?

378
00:36:11.142 --> 00:36:14.354
You're just being a human being.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

379
00:36:14.434 --> 00:36:18.476
It's normal. Those emotions are normal.

380
00:36:21.618 --> 00:36:23.920
Ever since I met Lilly...

381
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.454
it's been a sort of a spiritual awakening.

382
00:36:26.534 --> 00:36:31.379
You know, on a day-to-day level, like,
what you put in your body, it's important.

383
00:36:31.459 --> 00:36:35.358
- Yeah.
- But I really miss meat. I do.

384
00:36:36.609 --> 00:36:39.862
So, um, you and Lilly are together?
Is that... is that right?

385
00:36:39.942 --> 00:36:42.687
- No. We're friends. Totally friends.
- Oh.

386
00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:45.503
But, um, she's my yoga teacher.

387
00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:48.029
And Ragen's my teacher.

388
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:50.612
No, he's all of our teacher.

389
00:36:50.992 --> 00:36:54.146
And this delicious tofu
is part of his process.

390
00:36:54.226 --> 00:36:56.196
I love the tofu.

391
00:36:56.276 --> 00:37:00.191
I didn't think I would,
but the texture is different,

392
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:02.556
not like food, but...

393
00:37:04.459 --> 00:37:07.288
- Nobody gets hurt from it either.
- You can't choke on it.

394
00:37:20.084 --> 00:37:21.629
What's your favorite animal?

395
00:37:21.709 --> 00:37:25.104
My spirit animal or my...
just favorite animal in general?

396
00:37:25.184 --> 00:37:28.046
- I didn't really...
- I know, Bottlecap, that's your whole...

397
00:37:28.126 --> 00:37:31.029
job is to write it down,
and you didn't write it down.

398
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:33.358
What were you thinking?

399
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:40.548
- I feel so relaxed right now.
- Really? I'm not feeling fucking anything.

400
00:37:46.218 --> 00:37:48.154
Max!

401
00:37:48.234 --> 00:37:49.420
- Hey, Bree!
- What the fuck?

402
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.630
- Have you been here this whole time?
- Yeah.

403
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.737
- Oh, my God! I haven't seen you!
- I know. I got super stoned

404
00:37:54.817 --> 00:37:58.612
and passed out and...
now I can't find my straw hat.

405
00:37:58.692 --> 00:38:00.545
- Have you seen it?
- No, sorry.

406
00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:03.795
- My straw hat. Have you seen my hat?
- We'll let you know if we see it.

407
00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:08.487
Have you seen my hat?
Has anyone seen my hat, a straw hat?

408
00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:12.620
Fuck, you know, I left my keys in my hat
and I can't leave if I don't find my hat.

409
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.996
It's like... I always do this.

410
00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:17.879
His fucking hat.
Everyone just talks and talks and talks.

411
00:38:17.959 --> 00:38:20.166
No one's saying a fucking thing!

412
00:38:21.126 --> 00:38:24.632
I wish I had some money, so I can get
a house like this outside of the city.

413
00:38:24.712 --> 00:38:27.462
There's too many bugs out here. I hate it.

414
00:38:27.542 --> 00:38:30.354
This whole property, it's so unreal.

415
00:38:30.734 --> 00:38:33.717
I guess I don't really care
that much about money.

416
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:39.625
I know about you and Logan.

417
00:38:42.067 --> 00:38:43.904
What?

418
00:38:43.984 --> 00:38:46.192
He's my friend.

419
00:38:47.318 --> 00:38:49.795
Last night was amazing,
and now you're just over it.

420
00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:51.987
Can we just really not do this right now?

421
00:38:52.067 --> 00:38:55.162
I'm, like, rolling and I'm having fun
and I wanna go swimming.

422
00:38:55.242 --> 00:38:57.567
Alright, fine, go for a swim.

423
00:40:19.418 --> 00:40:23.009
Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.

424
00:40:33.351 --> 00:40:36.829
Too bad you can't sing.
You would've been a real cool rock singer.

425
00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:40.882
Fuck you, fuck you, okay?
And not that it's any of your business.

426
00:40:48.709 --> 00:40:50.558
Poor guy.

427
00:40:51.192 --> 00:40:53.218
What a lost soul.

428
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.576
Ruby.

429
00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:10.525
Hey.

430
00:41:11.459 --> 00:41:13.317
Ruby.

431
00:41:14.359 --> 00:41:16.225
Ruby.

432
00:41:31.434 --> 00:41:34.492
- What?
- Oh, man.

433
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.934
I think I might be in love with you.

434
00:41:44.176 --> 00:41:45.992
Really?

435
00:41:48.167 --> 00:41:50.012
I don't know. Probably.

436
00:41:50.092 --> 00:41:53.942
What's the fucking difference?
You're... fucking this guy.

437
00:41:54.875 --> 00:41:57.212
- I didn't fuck him.
- Oh, come on. I...

438
00:41:57.292 --> 00:41:59.653
Hey, guys, sorry...

439
00:42:00.533 --> 00:42:03.579
to interrupt but I'm gonna
go have a cigarette.

440
00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:05.987
I feel a little uncomfortable.

441
00:42:06.367 --> 00:42:09.087
Sorry, man, I didn't know
you guys were together.

442
00:42:09.167 --> 00:42:11.512
Yeah, we're not.

443
00:42:11.592 --> 00:42:13.476
Okay.

444
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.409
What do you want from me?

445
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.445
- Everything.
- Everything? Wow!

446
00:42:21.525 --> 00:42:26.042
- Well, at least you're honest.
- Hey. Let's make babies.

447
00:42:26.834 --> 00:42:32.059
Huh? Have a family
and stuff and little, like...

448
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:34.979
cabbages running around the city.

449
00:42:35.059 --> 00:42:37.296
Mixtures of you and me.

450
00:42:37.376 --> 00:42:39.720
That'd be pretty fucking...

451
00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:46.292
Gus, you're so high.

452
00:42:50.984 --> 00:42:53.292
Forget about it, don't worry.

453
00:42:54.692 --> 00:42:57.837
You got too many tattoos
to be a mommy anyway.

454
00:42:57.917 --> 00:43:01.158
I was... I was just joking.

455
00:43:04.742 --> 00:43:08.517
Fucking kids would come out
with fucking tattoos anyway.

456
00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:22.000
Happy New Year!

457
00:43:23.476 --> 00:43:25.741
Gimme one of those?

458
00:43:28.825 --> 00:43:31.738
- It's my last one.
- Oh.

459
00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:34.175
Thank you.

460
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:39.003
- Whoo!
- You got a lighter?

461
00:43:42.642 --> 00:43:45.009
I am a lucky...

462
00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:47.958
You are a waste.

463
00:43:55.576 --> 00:43:57.425
What now?

464
00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:02.645
What now? I don't know.
I think we're supposed to fight.

465
00:44:02.725 --> 00:44:06.337
- I mean, I don't wanna fight. I just...
- I don't wanna fight you, man.

466
00:44:06.417 --> 00:44:10.112
It's just what men do in these situations.
They fight. I'm not a good fighter though.

467
00:44:10.192 --> 00:44:15.071
I don't... I don't think I...
I'd probably pull your hair or something.

468
00:44:15.151 --> 00:44:18.411
- Don't pull, don't do that.
- Great. Well...

469
00:44:18.841 --> 00:44:22.417
Let's agree to not fight then. It's...

470
00:44:22.997 --> 00:44:26.246
Not a good way to...
end a party, you know?

471
00:44:26.326 --> 00:44:28.962
- I don't wanna fight you.
- Okay, good.

472
00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:32.320
I don't even know
why we would be fighting.

473
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.220
This girl.

474
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.233
Oh, yeah, the girl.

475
00:44:39.742 --> 00:44:41.983
Ruby's very special.

476
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.287
Fighting for the girl.

477
00:44:46.067 --> 00:44:48.454
She's tattooing me tomorrow.

478
00:44:48.534 --> 00:44:51.468
No matter what happens between us, it's...

479
00:44:51.548 --> 00:44:54.438
it's gonna last forever or at least
till I'm dead, you know,

480
00:44:54.518 --> 00:44:56.809
and my body decomposes...

481
00:45:00.459 --> 00:45:03.712
Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.

482
00:45:03.792 --> 00:45:06.695
- Are you thinking about her?
- Yeah, I am now.

483
00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:10.438
- Or you thinking about yourself?
- No lectures, please.

484
00:45:15.767 --> 00:45:18.009
What do you think they're doing?

485
00:45:18.609 --> 00:45:21.542
Huh? What do you think
they're doing in there?

486
00:45:24.251 --> 00:45:25.962
Hey.

487
00:45:27.417 --> 00:45:31.429
I can't get you to shut up
and when I ask you a question...

488
00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:40.403
Let me tell you a story, Gus.

489
00:45:40.583 --> 00:45:42.131
Once upon a time,

490
00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:45.854
there was a young punk
who thought he was invincible

491
00:45:45.934 --> 00:45:48.603
who thought nothing could hurt him.

492
00:45:48.683 --> 00:45:52.312
And every day,
he would go to fight a dragon.

493
00:45:52.392 --> 00:45:56.187
- It's a fucking stupid fairy tale.
- You're talking to a damn werewolf.

494
00:45:56.267 --> 00:45:58.570
And as usual, you missed the point.

495
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:02.645
Now shut up and listen.
Learn something for a change.

496
00:46:02.725 --> 00:46:07.683
So this punk would go into
the dragon's lair and he would yell,

497
00:46:07.763 --> 00:46:13.487
"Hey, you fucking dragon,
today is the day is the day."

498
00:46:13.567 --> 00:46:17.062
And the dragon looked up at him and said,

499
00:46:17.142 --> 00:46:21.812
"Just let the dragon sleep, Gus."

500
00:46:58.126 --> 00:47:00.567
And pray.

501
00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:04.162
You pray in silence.

502
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.809
Think of...

503
00:47:09.709 --> 00:47:12.217
something really beautiful.

504
00:47:14.042 --> 00:47:16.520
And enjoy the moment.

505
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.254
Feel the ground...

506
00:47:19.334 --> 00:47:21.708
that you stand upon.

507
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.158
And take a breath in...

508
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.625
What is this?

509
00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:07.036
Huh. Hey, Lou.

510
00:48:18.318 --> 00:48:20.150
Perfect.

511
00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:25.537
Hmm. Is it hard to do them
yourself, to yourself?

512
00:48:26.017 --> 00:48:30.271
Um, I've done this one myself but the
others, I've gotten done from friends.

513
00:48:30.351 --> 00:48:32.417
Oh, really?

514
00:48:34.067 --> 00:48:37.146
It's interesting to inflict pain
upon yourself.

515
00:48:37.226 --> 00:48:40.050
- It's hard to do.
- Is it harder to do?

516
00:48:42.126 --> 00:48:44.154
Am I hurting you?

517
00:48:44.234 --> 00:48:45.983
Yup.

518
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.004
I was talking to Logan.

519
00:48:50.084 --> 00:48:52.183
Yeah, I know.

520
00:48:58.334 --> 00:49:00.350
Almost done.

521
00:50:04.554 --> 00:50:07.479
- Yeah, I love it.
- It's all Ruby.

522
00:50:07.559 --> 00:50:09.479
Good job.

523
00:50:09.559 --> 00:50:12.312
I like how it's real spiritually.

524
00:50:12.392 --> 00:50:16.187
Is it an eye here? And this is a triangle.

525
00:50:16.267 --> 00:50:20.333
- And I like how this is a hand.
- Now, Shiva would approve. That's...

526
00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.503
- Yes.
- Who is Shiva?

527
00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:25.742
- Shiva is God.
- Ragen's an Aghori.

528
00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:28.854
- Oh.
- It's this really weird form of Hinduism.

529
00:50:28.934 --> 00:50:33.240
Uh, actually, I'm kinda developing
my own practice, you know,

530
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.172
but the Aghoris are
a major influence, you know?

531
00:50:37.342 --> 00:50:40.854
So we're doing this ritual tonight
and I'm gonna take part in it.

532
00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:45.570
Did you ever notice that almost
everything that feels good is a sin

533
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:47.729
at least, according to western religions?

534
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:49.937
Fucking amen to that, brother.

535
00:50:50.017 --> 00:50:54.018
Aghoris believe in the opposite that
everything that... that feels good,

536
00:50:54.098 --> 00:50:57.729
- it is good.
- Hey, um, Logan, can I...

537
00:50:57.809 --> 00:50:59.603
Can I ask you a question?

538
00:50:59.683 --> 00:51:02.545
Um, I gotta... I gotta go visit a friend

539
00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:05.562
and wondering if I could borrow your car?

540
00:51:06.142 --> 00:51:08.687
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, it's kind of an emergency...

541
00:51:08.767 --> 00:51:10.974
Gus! Are you asking to borrow his car?

542
00:51:11.054 --> 00:51:15.250
Yeah, my mom's sick, okay?
I gotta go visit her.

543
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.403
That's terrible, man, I'm so sorry, I...

544
00:51:19.483 --> 00:51:22.842
- It's okay.
- Is it okay if I drive him?

545
00:51:23.017 --> 00:51:25.403
- Where are we going?
- I really don't need a babysitter.

546
00:51:25.483 --> 00:51:28.904
Yeah, right. I don't know where you live.

547
00:51:28.984 --> 00:51:31.220
- Downtown Waterbury.
- Where?

548
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.362
Just take 84 to Highway 8, okay?

549
00:51:34.442 --> 00:51:37.314
- We call it the, uh, The Dirty Water.
- Why The Dirty Water?

550
00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:41.025
- Downtown Waterbury. Dirty water.
- I get it.

551
00:51:46.975 --> 00:51:50.238
- What are we doing? We're at a pawn shop?
- Yeah. Okay, I gotta get my mom a present.

552
00:51:50.318 --> 00:51:52.563
You're gonna get your mom
a present at a pawn shop?

553
00:51:52.643 --> 00:51:54.034
- Real classy, Gus.
- Thank you.

554
00:51:54.114 --> 00:51:56.907
What's the matter with you?
You're gonna leave me here? Is it safe?

555
00:51:56.987 --> 00:52:00.386
- Fuck no. Look around, huh?
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna kill you.

556
00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:11.609
Jesus Christ.

557
00:52:15.867 --> 00:52:20.655
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

558
00:52:26.659 --> 00:52:28.725
Hey, what's up?

559
00:52:30.284 --> 00:52:33.125
Uh, I need, I need to pawn some shit.

560
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:36.141
Okay?

561
00:52:36.567 --> 00:52:40.133
There you go.
Hey, that's a real Rolex, okay?

562
00:52:41.167 --> 00:52:43.854
- 60.
- Sold. Sold.

563
00:52:43.934 --> 00:52:46.400
How much for the cards?

564
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.146
- 2 bucks a piece.
- Are you nuts?

565
00:52:50.226 --> 00:52:53.360
That's Larry Johnson,
Kevin McHale and Lew Alcindor.

566
00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.004
What the fuck do I care
about Lew Alcindor?

567
00:52:56.084 --> 00:52:59.017
That's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's rookie card.

568
00:53:00.709 --> 00:53:02.970
What do you take me for?

569
00:53:19.542 --> 00:53:22.129
- What the fuck?
- What?

570
00:53:22.209 --> 00:53:23.962
Look at this bum.

571
00:53:24.042 --> 00:53:26.020
Uh, I think homeless
is a nicer way to say it.

572
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.579
He has been staring at me jerking off.

573
00:53:28.659 --> 00:53:30.745
- Maybe he has an itch.
- I'm gonna throw up.

574
00:53:30.825 --> 00:53:33.267
Oh, come on, it's a compliment.

575
00:53:34.809 --> 00:53:36.462
- So what did you get for your mom?
- What?

576
00:53:36.542 --> 00:53:38.396
What'd you get your mom? In the pawn shop?

577
00:53:38.476 --> 00:53:40.909
Uh, here.

578
00:53:41.667 --> 00:53:44.603
- Baseball cards?
- Basketball cards.

579
00:53:44.683 --> 00:53:47.212
My mom used to take me
to Knicks games as a kid.

580
00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:50.645
That's Larry Johnson
and Lew Alcindor's rookie card

581
00:53:50.725 --> 00:53:54.289
- who would later change his name to...
- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

582
00:53:55.809 --> 00:53:59.083
- How the fuck did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.

583
00:54:03.967 --> 00:54:07.729
Um... where is... where's your house?
Where are we going?

584
00:54:07.809 --> 00:54:10.592
Uh, just take a right here.

585
00:54:16.367 --> 00:54:18.800
- Right.
- Okay.

586
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:24.645
Just... just pull up here a sec, okay?
Right here. Right here. Just chill.

587
00:54:24.725 --> 00:54:26.811
- Now what?
- Just wait here a sec, okay?

588
00:54:26.891 --> 00:54:31.020
- You're not leaving me again.
- Why? You in love with me or something?

589
00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.354
I just don't wanna get raped
or murdered, okay?

590
00:54:33.434 --> 00:54:37.130
- Can we go to your mom's house?
- Just chill for one sec, okay? Just wait.

591
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.979
Oh, my God. Okay, Gus,
we should go, Gus, we should go.

592
00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:43.979
- Yo, hair long, what's going on? You lost?
- Oh, man, my fucking head's killing me.

593
00:54:44.059 --> 00:54:46.520
- You wanna get some medicine?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

594
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.254
- You a cop?
- Fuck, no. Do I look like a fucking cop?

595
00:54:49.334 --> 00:54:51.895
- What you looking for?
- Let's have some China White, man.

596
00:54:51.975 --> 00:54:55.071
Yo, fool, look around. Ain't no motherfucking
China White up in this piece.

597
00:54:55.151 --> 00:54:57.204
I got that brown shit though
if that's what you looking for?

598
00:54:57.284 --> 00:54:59.420
- Yeah, man, that's perfect.
- How much do you want?

599
00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.817
- Give me 40 and make it fat, alright?
- Alright. I'll be right back. I'll get it.

600
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:06.020
- You're buying drugs?
- What do you want from me, huh?

601
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.092
You're gonna get loaded
before we go see your mom?

602
00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:15.629
We're not going to see your mom, are we?

603
00:55:15.709 --> 00:55:17.879
Oh, my God.

604
00:55:17.959 --> 00:55:20.892
I can't believe I bought this shit.

605
00:55:27.009 --> 00:55:30.020
- My man.
- Hey, thanks, man.

606
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.287
- Oh, motherfucker! You motherfucker.
- Gus, wait! No, Gus!

607
00:55:33.367 --> 00:55:35.237
- Hey!
- Gus!

608
00:56:15.817 --> 00:56:18.025
Oh, fuck!

609
00:56:20.992 --> 00:56:23.858
Hey, you guys see...
see two people pass here?

610
00:56:25.059 --> 00:56:27.612
Hey, man, you guys got any shit to buy?

611
00:56:27.692 --> 00:56:29.602
- I just need a quick fix.
- You got money?

612
00:56:29.682 --> 00:56:32.375
Yeah, I got, like, 20 bucks, please.

613
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:35.654
- Oh, thank you.
- You cooking here?

614
00:56:35.734 --> 00:56:39.775
No, man. Alright, I gotta get home.

615
00:56:41.575 --> 00:56:43.625
Must be nice.

616
00:56:44.659 --> 00:56:46.941
Oh, fuck.

617
00:56:49.292 --> 00:56:50.706
Thank God.

618
00:57:01.183 --> 00:57:03.529
Why are you so sad?

619
00:57:03.609 --> 00:57:06.554
You know, I'm enjoying my life
more than most people, okay?

620
00:57:06.634 --> 00:57:10.512
- Yeah, at everybody else's expense.
- Oh, what, like, I'm the only one?

621
00:57:10.592 --> 00:57:13.138
Everyone I know is a fucking addict.

622
00:57:13.218 --> 00:57:16.887
Cigarettes and alcohol
kill more people than drugs.

623
00:57:16.967 --> 00:57:21.387
And not to mention fucking pharmaceuticals.
Half of America's a fucking addict!

624
00:57:21.467 --> 00:57:22.929
I just don't pay taxes on my shit.

625
00:57:23.009 --> 00:57:26.242
That's all anyone fucking cares about,
it's fucking money!

626
00:57:30.383 --> 00:57:33.647
- What is this, the silent treatment?
- You lied about your mother being sick

627
00:57:33.727 --> 00:57:36.095
- so you could buy drugs, Gus.
- No! No! No!

628
00:57:36.175 --> 00:57:39.588
That is so wrong on so many levels.

629
00:57:40.159 --> 00:57:42.946
You don't give a shit
about anybody or anything.

630
00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:45.387
All you fucking care about
is your fucking smack.

631
00:57:45.467 --> 00:57:48.476
Why don't you go and fuck
Mr. The Other Days,

632
00:57:48.556 --> 00:57:50.938
the vegetarian rock star
and just leave me the fuck alone.

633
00:57:51.018 --> 00:57:52.620
- Okay.
- I'm so fucking stupid.

634
00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.379
- Fine.
- I'm so fucking dumb!

635
00:57:56.159 --> 00:57:59.612
You know, we made love, alright?
And I thought that was real.

636
00:57:59.692 --> 00:58:03.025
And you skip off and give me
the fucking run around.

637
00:58:05.926 --> 00:58:07.733
Fuck.

638
00:58:09.717 --> 00:58:12.209
You fell asleep inside me.

639
00:58:13.934 --> 00:58:16.795
- What?
- You fell asleep.

640
00:58:16.875 --> 00:58:21.133
You nodded off in the middle
of having sex with me.

641
00:58:23.142 --> 00:58:27.408
Do you have any idea
what that feels like for a girl?

642
00:58:28.467 --> 00:58:31.354
- Ruby. Listen...
- I don't fucking care.

643
00:58:31.434 --> 00:58:34.092
- It's dope.
- I don't care.

644
00:58:38.634 --> 00:58:40.512
Fuck it, whatever.

645
00:58:40.592 --> 00:58:42.245
- Whatever, baby.
- Whatever.

646
00:58:42.325 --> 00:58:46.387
You know what? Fucking dig that gold.

647
00:58:46.467 --> 00:58:49.395
Fucking keep digging that fucking gold.

648
00:58:49.475 --> 00:58:51.537
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, dig it.

649
00:58:51.617 --> 00:58:53.287
- Fuck you.
- Dig gold, baby.

650
00:58:53.367 --> 00:58:54.562
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

651
00:58:54.642 --> 00:58:57.687
I'm not gonna let
some fucking junkie judge me!

652
00:58:57.767 --> 00:59:01.495
You're... sitting there
and shooting up in front of me?

653
00:59:01.575 --> 00:59:06.687
Oh, I'm a fucking gold digger because
I'm not like, "Hey, awesome, yippee!

654
00:59:06.767 --> 00:59:10.295
"I've got no money and no job, no ambition

655
00:59:10.375 --> 00:59:13.604
"and I spend all my money on smack.
What a catch!"

656
00:59:13.684 --> 00:59:15.924
- That makes me a fucking gold digger?
- Whatever.

657
00:59:16.004 --> 00:59:18.620
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

658
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.085
This has nothing to do with Logan.

659
00:59:21.165 --> 00:59:24.324
At least, he has his fucking shit together.
I'm a grown up, Gus.

660
00:59:24.404 --> 00:59:26.570
I'm a grown-ass woman. I'm older than you.

661
00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:30.327
What am I fucking doing
wasting my time with you?

662
00:59:33.076 --> 00:59:35.375
What am I doing?

663
00:59:55.918 --> 00:59:57.683
Gus?

664
00:59:58.176 --> 00:59:59.758
Gus.

665
01:00:02.118 --> 01:00:03.925
Gus.

666
01:00:04.509 --> 01:00:08.200
Gus, Gus! Fuck. Gus.

667
01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:11.134
Gus, are you alright?

668
01:00:12.717 --> 01:00:15.329
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

669
01:00:15.409 --> 01:00:17.450
Oh, God.

670
01:00:32.926 --> 01:00:35.158
Jesus Christ.

671
01:00:37.183 --> 01:00:40.017
- Gus, get out of the car.
- I'm fine.

672
01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.658
Come on, get up.

673
01:00:43.617 --> 01:00:45.245
- Okay.
- Okay.

674
01:00:45.325 --> 01:00:47.624
Okay, okay.

675
01:00:47.704 --> 01:00:51.570
If he's not in immediate danger you need
to fill out the forms and wait your turn.

676
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:54.579
Look, lady, you're not listening to me.
He is in immediate danger.

677
01:00:54.659 --> 01:00:57.448
He practically just OD'd in my car.

678
01:01:00.425 --> 01:01:04.287
Okay, he definitely has problems
but he's not in immediate danger.

679
01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:07.295
So please, take a seat
and fill out the form.

680
01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:09.804
Lady, I'm not an expert,
but he's the color green.

681
01:01:09.884 --> 01:01:11.496
He just threw up and it was a weird color

682
01:01:11.576 --> 01:01:14.262
and if I hadn't been there he probably
would've choked on it and died.

683
01:01:14.342 --> 01:01:16.646
I think something is very wrong
with him and he needs help.

684
01:01:16.726 --> 01:01:20.554
Can you please get a doctor? This is
a fucking hospital, can you get a doctor?

685
01:01:20.634 --> 01:01:23.554
First... please don't raise your voice.

686
01:01:23.634 --> 01:01:26.117
And where did he go?

687
01:01:27.967 --> 01:01:29.662
Uh...

688
01:01:29.742 --> 01:01:31.346
Gus?

689
01:01:32.562 --> 01:01:34.329
Gus!

690
01:01:34.509 --> 01:01:37.864
Um, excuse me, Flannel.
Uh, it'll be just a minute.

691
01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.667
Gus?

692
01:01:40.867 --> 01:01:44.187
Gus? Hi, did somebody
sick-looking just run past here?

693
01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:47.596
- Yeah, it's a hospital.
- Alright, smart ass, thanks a lot.

694
01:01:47.676 --> 01:01:50.534
- Gus!
- Sick people everywhere.

695
01:01:51.034 --> 01:01:52.850
Gus!

696
01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:02.753
Gus, what the fuck?
Dude, you can't just leave me like that.

697
01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.820
I've been looking everywhere for you.
You need a doctor.

698
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.562
Look... I'm fine.

699
01:02:07.642 --> 01:02:10.579
You're not fine.
You just threw up in the car.

700
01:02:10.659 --> 01:02:13.912
That's my bad. I'm... I'm fine.

701
01:02:13.992 --> 01:02:16.276
Honestly, I'm fine.

702
01:02:17.051 --> 01:02:19.517
How amazing is that?

703
01:02:21.884 --> 01:02:24.250
Fucking amazing, huh?

704
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:30.429
It's like a day old, not even,
it's like an hour old.

705
01:02:30.809 --> 01:02:32.917
Unbelievable.

706
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:36.629
It doesn't know anything yet.

707
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:39.708
It's completely pure.

708
01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:48.300
Do you think that we're born
a certain way...

709
01:02:49.018 --> 01:02:51.558
or that life shapes us into who we are?

710
01:03:07.026 --> 01:03:09.437
That one's really ugly.

711
01:03:09.717 --> 01:03:13.092
Well, you know, ugly babies,
they need love too.

712
01:03:16.867 --> 01:03:18.958
Come on.

713
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:38.495
Ho-ho-ho, it's about fucking time.
So glad you could make it.

714
01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:41.017
Yeah, sorry I'm late.

715
01:04:41.751 --> 01:04:43.992
Apology accepted.

716
01:04:50.392 --> 01:04:55.158
- What's that?
- Meat. Isn't that what you wanted?

717
01:04:58.442 --> 01:05:00.929
I can't. I'm sorry.

718
01:05:01.009 --> 01:05:04.929
I don't mean any disrespect,
but can I please go?

719
01:05:05.009 --> 01:05:08.303
That's alright, Lilly.
Shiva insists on free will.

720
01:05:08.383 --> 01:05:10.950
Yeah, but... this is too much.

721
01:05:11.759 --> 01:05:13.787
Of course.

722
01:05:18.742 --> 01:05:23.071
Would you rather be a lion or a squirrel?

723
01:05:23.151 --> 01:05:27.803
The ancient Aghori believed that the best
way to honor Shiva and her principles

724
01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:30.342
was to eat human flesh.

725
01:05:31.467 --> 01:05:34.750
- Shut up.
- It's true.

726
01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:59.179
Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.

727
01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:02.354
Well, if she wants to hang out
with fucking cannibal freaks...

728
01:06:02.534 --> 01:06:04.912
be my fucking guest.

729
01:06:04.992 --> 01:06:08.258
I'm sure that's good for your asthma.

730
01:06:08.409 --> 01:06:10.292
Fuck off.

731
01:06:13.009 --> 01:06:14.120
Where we going?

732
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.979
As far away from that low scene
as possible. Far, far fucking away.

733
01:06:18.059 --> 01:06:23.370
"Most men pursue pleasure with such
breathless haste that they hurry past it."

734
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:25.829
Hey, leave Kierkegaard out of this, okay?

735
01:06:25.909 --> 01:06:28.038
He got nothing to do with it.

736
01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:31.209
It means slow the fuck down.

737
01:06:45.826 --> 01:06:51.367
- That is not what I meant.
- No, no, no. I'm a fucking addict, okay?

738
01:07:18.892 --> 01:07:21.376
Put your hands where I can see them.

739
01:07:23.176 --> 01:07:25.033
Sir!

740
01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:29.109
Put your hands on the steering wheel.

741
01:07:32.992 --> 01:07:35.009
Alright.

742
01:07:37.259 --> 01:07:39.733
They don't know the real truth.

743
01:07:42.675 --> 01:07:46.703
They don't know the real truth.

744
01:07:47.483 --> 01:07:50.125
Obama's in the White House.

745
01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:03.692
I'm in jail. Ugh, fucking jail!

746
01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.192
Hey, you...

747
01:08:11.784 --> 01:08:14.262
do you know the real truth?

748
01:08:14.342 --> 01:08:16.120
What's that, man?

749
01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.120
Did you vote for Obama?

750
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.470
No, man, I didn't vote.

751
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:26.317
You know Obama's trying to steal all
the money from the Native Americans?

752
01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:31.950
Fucking a... really he is.

753
01:08:32.342 --> 01:08:36.595
That's why I'm in here.
I had a website up telling the truth.

754
01:08:36.675 --> 01:08:39.354
We had to get the truth out there.

755
01:08:39.434 --> 01:08:42.592
And my website crashed again.

756
01:08:43.425 --> 01:08:45.667
I'm in jail.

757
01:08:47.934 --> 01:08:50.237
It's not a coincidence.

758
01:08:50.717 --> 01:08:52.958
I'm an Arawak...

759
01:08:53.409 --> 01:08:56.303
and we are owed 2 billion dollars.

760
01:08:57.283 --> 01:09:01.500
Do you think a black guy is gonna
give us our 2 billion dollars?

761
01:09:04.225 --> 01:09:06.541
You know, I hate to say it...

762
01:09:07.467 --> 01:09:10.025
but if somebody doesn't pay us...

763
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:13.079
somebody might make him...

764
01:09:13.159 --> 01:09:15.179
go away.

765
01:09:15.459 --> 01:09:17.892
'Cause that's a lot of money.

766
01:09:18.992 --> 01:09:20.579
Money, money, money.

767
01:09:20.659 --> 01:09:24.476
You know, that's what it's all about
at the end of the day.

768
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.933
And that's a crazy part about it.

769
01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:31.679
We need the money...

770
01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:34.262
just so we can go live someplace

771
01:09:34.342 --> 01:09:36.767
where money doesn't matter.

772
01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.917
You fucking hear me?

773
01:09:41.876 --> 01:09:43.650
Hey!

774
01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:51.742
Do you fucking hear me
or am I talking to myself?

775
01:09:54.567 --> 01:09:57.782
I asked you a question, motherfuck.

776
01:09:59.267 --> 01:10:01.358
Gottsegen.

777
01:10:03.418 --> 01:10:07.625
Three steps back, please.
Little bit more. There you go.

778
01:11:49.425 --> 01:11:51.620
Where are we going?
The turn off is back there.

779
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.367
I'm not taking you back into the city.
Not in the shape you're in.

780
01:11:56.592 --> 01:11:58.746
Where are you taking me?

781
01:11:58.826 --> 01:12:00.783
Your mother's.

782
01:12:08.059 --> 01:12:11.287
I don't know, Gus. You know...

783
01:12:12.967 --> 01:12:16.027
Somewhere along the line, you gotta
take a little bit of responsibility,

784
01:12:16.107 --> 01:12:19.387
just a little bit. Oh, put that thing out.

785
01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:23.043
- I'm an addict, Dad, okay?
- Yeah, but you've...

786
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.267
- I bet you are. I bet you are.
- Get your hands off me.

787
01:12:26.347 --> 01:12:27.937
- Let me see this.
- Get your fucking hands off me.

788
01:12:28.017 --> 01:12:30.954
- What is that? How'd you get those?
- I got them playing hoops, Dad.

789
01:12:31.034 --> 01:12:33.896
You want to give me an honest answer now?
No. Of course not.

790
01:12:33.976 --> 01:12:37.920
'Cause you don't even think that I just
bailed you out of county for heroin possession

791
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.773
and driving a stolen car. You know,
you're lucky he's not pressing charges.

792
01:12:42.853 --> 01:12:48.303
I... not... not every kid whose parents
get divorced ends up being a drug addict.

793
01:12:48.383 --> 01:12:51.841
You decided to do that. That was you.

794
01:12:53.259 --> 01:12:55.771
- You're killing your mother.
- Oh, fuck you.

795
01:12:55.851 --> 01:12:58.263
- Since when do you care about her?
- I never stopped caring...

796
01:12:58.343 --> 01:13:01.529
Oh, cut the crap. When was
the last time you went to see her?

797
01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:04.245
When was the last time you went to see her?
When was the last time you called her?

798
01:13:04.325 --> 01:13:07.079
When was the last time you checked
to see if she was okay?

799
01:13:07.159 --> 01:13:10.096
She's my ex-wife. She's not my wife.

800
01:13:10.176 --> 01:13:13.008
She's all alone, and you don't even care.

801
01:13:39.684 --> 01:13:41.987
Can I borrow some money?

802
01:13:42.367 --> 01:13:44.203
Sure, sure.

803
01:13:44.283 --> 01:13:47.170
I'll take it out of the damages
to the Rolls.

804
01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:50.012
You know, you just left it in the woods?

805
01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.529
Gus, you didn't even...
you didn't even make a phone call.

806
01:13:52.609 --> 01:13:54.620
You didn't even...
were you gonna ever tell anybody?

807
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.783
What did... what did you think
was gonna happen to it?

808
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.245
- Coming in?
- No. No, Gus, I'm not coming in.

809
01:14:06.517 --> 01:14:10.054
Dad, I mean... she's sick.

810
01:14:10.134 --> 01:14:12.512
And it could be the last time.

811
01:14:12.842 --> 01:14:14.612
Let me ask you something.

812
01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:18.054
Are you going in there
to give her love and support?

813
01:14:18.134 --> 01:14:21.367
Or are you just going in
to take her money?

814
01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:24.017
Both.

815
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.020
Today's a good day.
She'll be happy to see you.

816
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.825
- Well, I'm happy to see you.
- Well, I'll leave you alone.

817
01:15:05.905 --> 01:15:07.966
- Okay.
- Give me a shout if you need anything.

818
01:15:08.046 --> 01:15:09.454
My Gus. Mmm.

819
01:15:09.534 --> 01:15:11.179
You smell like cigarettes.

820
01:15:11.259 --> 01:15:14.537
Yeah, well, Dad was smoking in the car.

821
01:15:14.617 --> 01:15:15.954
He didn't wanna come in, huh?

822
01:15:16.034 --> 01:15:18.529
He wanted to,
but I told him to go fuck himself.

823
01:15:18.609 --> 01:15:20.850
Good thinking.

824
01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.302
- I'm scared, Gus.
- Mom, please, just chill...

825
01:15:26.186 --> 01:15:28.862
Alright? Cindy says you're doing well.
She says your vitals are good.

826
01:15:28.942 --> 01:15:31.662
So, just please,
stop stressing yourself out, okay?

827
01:15:31.742 --> 01:15:33.495
What does Cindy know?
She doesn't know anything.

828
01:15:33.575 --> 01:15:34.787
- Ma.
- I know myself.

829
01:15:34.867 --> 01:15:37.725
I can't deal with this right now, okay?

830
01:15:41.909 --> 01:15:44.938
Hey, look... I got you a present.
Should I?

831
01:15:45.018 --> 01:15:46.345
- Presents?
- Yeah.

832
01:15:46.425 --> 01:15:48.612
Mmm, I like presents.

833
01:15:48.692 --> 01:15:51.829
- Look, basketball cards.
- Oh.

834
01:15:51.909 --> 01:15:53.662
- That's Larry Johnson.
- Oh, thanks.

835
01:15:53.742 --> 01:15:57.189
- And that's Lew Alcindor's rookie card.
- Yeah.

836
01:15:57.547 --> 01:15:59.512
- Karee... Yeah, skyhook.
- Kareem.

837
01:15:59.592 --> 01:16:02.038
- Skyhook.
- Skyhook.

838
01:16:02.118 --> 01:16:04.495
You remember when you used to take me
to Knicks games when I was a kid?

839
01:16:04.575 --> 01:16:07.846
How could I forget? You made me
take you home after the first quarter.

840
01:16:07.926 --> 01:16:11.341
Hey, Ma, I was 5 years old.
What do you expect?

841
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.920
You're staying here, right?

842
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.155
- Yeah, of course, of course.
- Tonight? Good.

843
01:16:19.235 --> 01:16:21.829
We'll hang out later.

844
01:16:21.909 --> 01:16:24.871
I was wondering if I could borrow
the car for a little bit?

845
01:16:24.951 --> 01:16:27.454
I need the car here in case
I have to go back to the hospital.

846
01:16:27.534 --> 01:16:29.579
You're gonna be fine, and look,
you can take the wagon.

847
01:16:29.659 --> 01:16:32.004
- I sold the wagon.
- What do you mean you sold the wagon?

848
01:16:32.084 --> 01:16:37.483
Why did you sell the wagon? I used to go
to school in that car. For me! Ma, for me.

849
01:16:40.409 --> 01:16:43.188
- Can I take the bike at least?
- That bike's too dangerous.

850
01:16:43.268 --> 01:16:45.704
- You didn't sell that, did you?
- No, I'm selling it. It's too dangerous.

851
01:16:45.784 --> 01:16:48.370
Oh, my God,
you used to drive it all the time.

852
01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:51.983
I looked good on that bike.
It's too dangerous.

853
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.329
Where are you going?

854
01:16:58.409 --> 01:17:01.020
- I have a date with Destiny.
- Who?

855
01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:04.020
This girl I met on Craigslist.
Her name's Destiny.

856
01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.637
She's Dominican Republican, you know.
She's got blue eyes, got a slamming ass.

857
01:17:07.717 --> 01:17:10.596
- You know, massive kabukas...
- Big tits? You like big boobs?

858
01:17:10.676 --> 01:17:13.946
Yeah, I love big boobs. Oh, she loves me.

859
01:17:16.134 --> 01:17:18.579
Seriously though, ma...

860
01:17:19.159 --> 01:17:21.600
can I borrow some money for dinner?

861
01:17:22.684 --> 01:17:24.012
Is it really for dinner, Gus?

862
01:17:24.092 --> 01:17:25.671
- Yes.
- Gus, really?

863
01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:28.079
Ma, why is it so hard
to believe that I have a date?

864
01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:31.345
Because you haven't taken a shower.
I can't believe you are going on a date.

865
01:17:31.425 --> 01:17:32.507
- Ma.
- Look me in the eye.

866
01:17:32.587 --> 01:17:33.870
- Why? Why?
- Gus.

867
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:37.145
I wanna make sure you are telling me
the truth. Look me in the eye, come on.

868
01:17:37.225 --> 01:17:39.975
- Ma.
- Look me in the eye.

869
01:17:45.483 --> 01:17:48.287
- Thank you.
- Is it? See? Just...

870
01:17:48.367 --> 01:17:49.954
- Uh, take the wallet out.
- Okay.

871
01:17:50.034 --> 01:17:52.334
Bring it over here. Over here, Gus. Gus.

872
01:17:52.414 --> 01:17:55.788
- Yeah. Ma. Okay.
- Bring it over... Gus, bring it over here.

873
01:17:55.992 --> 01:17:58.787
- Here.
- Take 40.

874
01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:01.446
It's 20, 20, 10, okay?

875
01:18:01.826 --> 01:18:03.662
- I'm putting the wallet back.
- Thank you.

876
01:18:03.742 --> 01:18:05.975
There it goes.

877
01:18:06.225 --> 01:18:08.083
Thank you.

878
01:18:09.859 --> 01:18:14.287
- What's this girl's name again?
- It's that girl, Ruby I told you about.

879
01:18:14.367 --> 01:18:16.479
- Oh, yeah, Ruby.
- Hmm.

880
01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:18.924
I thought you said
she was just your friend?

881
01:18:19.004 --> 01:18:22.425
Yeah, she is, though she... yeah, yeah.

882
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:24.984
But I love her now.

883
01:19:59.717 --> 01:20:02.000
Hey, what's up?

884
01:20:07.542 --> 01:20:10.012
Were you waiting here for me?

885
01:20:10.092 --> 01:20:12.240
Don't flatter yourself.

886
01:20:14.267 --> 01:20:16.558
Why? You're not happy to see me?

887
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:22.737
No, it's not that.

888
01:20:22.817 --> 01:20:26.392
Uh-oh. Sounds like something.

889
01:20:27.525 --> 01:20:29.792
Should we talk?

890
01:20:34.367 --> 01:20:36.387
I think so.

891
01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:39.600
Fuck that.
That sounds like a terrible idea.

892
01:20:40.475 --> 01:20:44.400
- I didn't come here for a big talk.
- What did you come here for?

893
01:20:52.067 --> 01:20:54.620
Ruby... I might be in love with you...

894
01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.346
- Don't. Mm-mm.
- Oh, don't what?

895
01:21:00.342 --> 01:21:02.100
Hey.

896
01:21:02.575 --> 01:21:05.058
Don't make this harder for me.

897
01:21:09.483 --> 01:21:11.708
Is it about Logan?

898
01:21:15.499 --> 01:21:19.258
No. It's not about Logan.

899
01:21:19.592 --> 01:21:23.787
It's about me. And I just told him
the same fucking thing.

900
01:21:29.492 --> 01:21:31.741
I need to be alone.

901
01:21:33.034 --> 01:21:36.096
I'm never alone. I've never been alone.

902
01:21:36.176 --> 01:21:40.479
And it's hard.
It's hard to break patterns.

903
01:21:40.759 --> 01:21:43.309
And I need to be with a grown up.

904
01:21:47.409 --> 01:21:50.893
So that maybe he can teach me
what that means.

905
01:21:59.876 --> 01:22:03.317
Wait, what are... you're leaving?

906
01:22:04.409 --> 01:22:06.637
What's the difference?

907
01:22:06.717 --> 01:22:08.979
This is how you're leaving?

908
01:22:09.659 --> 01:22:12.071
What am I supposed to do? I...

909
01:22:12.151 --> 01:22:14.434
I don't know.

910
01:22:18.218 --> 01:22:22.891
- Come give me a hug.
- Fuck. Alright, fine.

911
01:22:33.592 --> 01:22:36.125
Hey, what if I cleaned up?

912
01:22:38.851 --> 01:22:40.871
What if I cleaned up?

913
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:43.512
You know, I could, I could.

914
01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:46.412
I'm just young.
I'm just... just experimenting.

915
01:22:46.492 --> 01:22:51.517
I mean, I'm just a dick.
You know, I could, I could, Ruby.

916
01:22:53.726 --> 01:22:56.225
You know, you could help me.

917
01:22:57.051 --> 01:23:01.075
For you... for you I could stop.

918
01:23:04.325 --> 01:23:06.129
Gus.

919
01:23:06.409 --> 01:23:10.400
If you can stop, yes, please, stop.

920
01:23:13.567 --> 01:23:16.017
And I want to help you.

921
01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:20.033
But I'm just trying to help myself too.

922
01:23:29.942 --> 01:23:33.717
I wanna be your friend, Gus.
Will you be my friend?

923
01:23:35.534 --> 01:23:38.067
My fucking face always betrays me.

924
01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:49.267
I can give you a ride to the city.

925
01:23:53.775 --> 01:23:57.541
- I got a train ticket.
- What about to the station?

926
01:24:02.809 --> 01:24:05.692
- Cab's on its way, so...
- Okay.

927
01:24:11.034 --> 01:24:14.562
- It would be more fun to ride with me.
- Yeah, no shit.

928
01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:17.675
But I'd never get where I'm going.

929
01:25:52.634 --> 01:25:54.854
What are you looking for?

930
01:25:55.034 --> 01:25:57.258
What am I looking for?
