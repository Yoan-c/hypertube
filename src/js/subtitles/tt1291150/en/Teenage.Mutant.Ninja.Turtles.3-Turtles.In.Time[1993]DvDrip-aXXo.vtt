2
00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.156
Prince Kenshin,
you must turn back.

3
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.556
Return with us at once.

4
00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:37.854
No!

5
00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.997
Give up your weapon.

6
00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:55.477
Do not harm him.
Take him prisoner.

7
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.649
No! You will have to
kill me first.

8
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.058
Take him to the castle.

9
00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:08.086
Mitsu!

10
00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:09.328
Beat it.

11
00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.371
All right.

12
00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:59.745
Rock 'n' roll!

13
00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:14.328
Turtle tantrum.

14
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.034
Hold it.
Oh, Raph, come on.

15
00:04:20.073 --> 00:04:21.502
What's going on, Raph?

16
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.517
Nothing.

17
00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:25.345
Have patience, my son.

18
00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:26.798
What are we doing this for?

19
00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:30.702
Day after day, practicing,
killing ourselves, for what?

20
00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:31.705
Oh, Raphael.

21
00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:33.937
Nobody appreciates us.
Nobody sees us.

22
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.360
Nobody even knows
we're alive down here!

23
00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:39.832
Hey, guys.
How's it going?

24
00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:43.063
Hi. Fine.
Good hair day?

25
00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:44.468
Brought you some stuff.

26
00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:45.471
I love stuff.

27
00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:47.097
Goodies!

28
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.129
Later.

29
00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:50.504
Let's see what's in the bags.

30
00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:53.296
OK, here are the keys
to my apartment...

31
00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:55.131
somewhere... stop peeking!

32
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.231
No peeking.

33
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:57.338
I'm not peeking.

34
00:04:57.372 --> 00:04:59.737
- I'm spelunking for pork rinds.
- Don't lose them.

35
00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:02.019
God, I need this vacation.

36
00:05:02.063 --> 00:05:03.724
Take us with you, April.

37
00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:05.426
Come on, take us with you.

38
00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.163
Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, guys.

39
00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:10.103
My suitcases are very full.

40
00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:11.696
Oh, too bad.

41
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.732
Hey, I didn't forget
about you guys.

42
00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:17.506
I bought a lot of fun stuff
at the flea market for you.

43
00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:19.308
All right!

44
00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:20.814
OK, where's Raph?

45
00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.244
He's in another funk.

46
00:05:22.297 --> 00:05:23.964
- Again?
- A major funk.

47
00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.742
Maybe this'll cheer him up.

48
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.906
Hey, smooth.

49
00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:28.142
Pretty cool, huh?

50
00:05:28.183 --> 00:05:30.549
Nifty lid!

51
00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:32.382
All right, this is for Mikey.

52
00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:35.350
All righty.

53
00:05:35.407 --> 00:05:36.669
Hey, it's a lampshade.

54
00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:40.702
Let's see. What else
do we have here?

55
00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:43.374
And for Leonardo,
there you go.

56
00:05:44.817 --> 00:05:46.249
- And Donatello...
- Japanese swords!

57
00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:47.996
This'll keep you
busy while I'm gone.

58
00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:49.025
Thanks.

59
00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:52.199
All right, and for Splinter...

60
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:53.833
where is he anyway?

61
00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:55.901
He's doing rat stuff.

62
00:05:55.944 --> 00:05:57.343
Found this...

63
00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.542
actually, I don't
really know what it is.

64
00:06:00.582 --> 00:06:03.551
Some kind of a weird
antique or something.

65
00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:06.083
I think it's Japanese.

66
00:06:06.121 --> 00:06:08.419
Elvis Presley in "Blue Hawaii."

67
00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:10.481
You're so cute.

68
00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:14.256
A super androdyne
radio with triode tubes!

69
00:06:14.296 --> 00:06:15.263
Boss!

70
00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:17.697
Hey, what's that, April?

71
00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:22.795
Some kind of weird
Japanese antique...

72
00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:24.896
egg timer.

73
00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.215
Kenshin, I forbid you
to leave the castle.

74
00:07:20.257 --> 00:07:22.184
You have disgraced me.

75
00:07:22.187 --> 00:07:24.849
It is you who have
disgraced me, Father...

76
00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:28.127
with your unjust war.

77
00:07:40.256 --> 00:07:42.656
Walker.

78
00:07:47.716 --> 00:07:50.579
Walker, you're alive.

79
00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:53.728
Yes, I'd say that
was a fair assumption.

80
00:07:53.762 --> 00:07:56.993
Survived a shipwreck, built
some new ones, and, well...

81
00:07:57.032 --> 00:07:59.601
here I am, hungry again.

82
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.698
Niles!

83
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:02.868
Move along, lads.

84
00:08:05.212 --> 00:08:07.681
Your sentries, I believe.

85
00:08:07.704 --> 00:08:08.937
Must be a great comfort
to know...

86
00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:11.984
how well-protected
you are, Lord Norinaga.

87
00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:16.506
Kenshin, inside!

88
00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:17.843
Now!

89
00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:37.172
Children are such
a pest, aren't they?

90
00:08:37.261 --> 00:08:39.821
Especially when they
side with the enemy.

91
00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:42.230
Oh, dear. Damn nuisance.

92
00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:43.893
I just keep birds now.

93
00:08:43.935 --> 00:08:45.334
Little finches.

94
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.637
Shut up, Niles.

95
00:08:47.729 --> 00:08:49.594
Right. I have three ships
sitting in your harbor...

96
00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:51.428
Loaded down with powder
and muskets...

97
00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:54.629
absolutely guaranteed
to win your ambitious war.

98
00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:42.841
Kappa.

99
00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:56.627
"Open wide the gates of time."

100
00:10:08.822 --> 00:10:11.484
Uh... guys?

101
00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:13.493
Guys!

102
00:10:16.797 --> 00:10:19.166
What's going on?

103
00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:20.844
Wait a second here.

104
00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.825
Lay low!

105
00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.986
Cover your face!

106
00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:31.724
Feels like tornado weather!

107
00:10:34.444 --> 00:10:36.173
No way!

108
00:10:39.816 --> 00:10:41.306
She's a man!

109
00:11:06.064 --> 00:11:07.258
Kappa!

110
00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:17.405
You have that effect on people,
don't you, master?

111
00:11:17.442 --> 00:11:19.672
Out cold.

112
00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:52.255
Wakey, wakey. Wake up.

113
00:11:52.293 --> 00:11:55.194
Hey, guys, these clothes
look familiar to you?

114
00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:56.753
Wake up. Wake up...

115
00:11:56.798 --> 00:12:00.328
weird-looking
James Dean dude.

116
00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:02.850
I think he's coming around.

117
00:12:03.352 --> 00:12:04.410
Kappa!

118
00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:06.444
Cappa? Cappuccino?

119
00:12:06.488 --> 00:12:07.921
Nah, it makes me hyper.

120
00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:09.082
What's a kappa?

121
00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:11.721
Ancient Japanese demon.

122
00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:15.696
Some were good,
and some were very bad.

123
00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:20.901
Demons.

124
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.306
Hey, he speaks English!

125
00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:24.935
Where's he from anyways?

126
00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:29.540
Well, judging from sword,
I'd say feudal Japan.

127
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.518
That explains why
he speaks our language.

128
00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:34.210
See, England started
trading with Japan...

129
00:12:34.252 --> 00:12:35.742
All right, already.

130
00:12:35.787 --> 00:12:38.255
How'd you get in April's pants?

131
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.349
I want to know what
happened to April.

132
00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:45.028
It seems the scepter
has magic powers...

133
00:12:45.219 --> 00:12:49.053
and somehow transported
them both through time.

134
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.523
Hold on, dudes.

135
00:12:50.558 --> 00:12:53.653
If April's back in feudal Japan,
does that mean we, like...

136
00:12:53.717 --> 00:12:56.584
have to ride that scepter
back through time to get her?

137
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.817
You have no choice, my son.

138
00:12:59.856 --> 00:13:03.257
Awesome! But do you think
they had pizza back then?

139
00:13:03.293 --> 00:13:05.955
Get out of town.

140
00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:18.066
What's going on, Captain?

141
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:20.695
Ignorant, superstitious fools.

142
00:13:20.737 --> 00:13:22.637
We was just wondering!

143
00:13:22.673 --> 00:13:24.864
Them, you moronic toad!

144
00:13:24.997 --> 00:13:27.124
They seem to think the woman's
some kind of witch.

145
00:13:27.165 --> 00:13:29.099
She's some sort of a witch!

146
00:13:29.134 --> 00:13:30.465
Shut up.

147
00:13:59.319 --> 00:14:00.786
Some sort of a witch!

148
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.448
Would you keep quiet!

149
00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:11.291
Sorry?

150
00:14:12.432 --> 00:14:15.162
Look, I took Spanish
in high school.

151
00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:20.312
Hey, easy.

152
00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:51.206
Next time, ask me
to turn it off.

153
00:14:55.846 --> 00:14:58.415
Where is my son, witch?

154
00:14:58.444 --> 00:15:01.811
Hey, I really don't have
a clue, OK...

155
00:15:01.847 --> 00:15:04.941
so why don't you just
drop this macho stuff?

156
00:15:06.552 --> 00:15:09.817
Lord Norinaga, allow me.

157
00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:25.326
The Daimyo and his court
believe that you're a witch...

158
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.682
who has somehow managed
to spirit away his son.

159
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:29.584
Is this true?

160
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.854
Yeah, it's true.

161
00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:37.327
I am a witch.

162
00:15:37.362 --> 00:15:39.624
See that?

163
00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:43.109
I shrunk four
incredibly cool guys...

164
00:15:43.122 --> 00:15:45.113
and I locked them in there.

165
00:15:45.158 --> 00:15:46.250
Really?

166
00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:55.225
Then go ahead, witch, shrink me.

167
00:15:57.103 --> 00:16:01.238
Don't push me, Ruffles...

168
00:16:01.308 --> 00:16:05.972
or I'll melt you into
a steaming puddle of puke.

169
00:16:12.985 --> 00:16:14.418
She has no power.

170
00:16:14.453 --> 00:16:16.278
Let me question her
about your son.

171
00:16:16.317 --> 00:16:17.841
Then you can roast her,
toast her...

172
00:16:17.885 --> 00:16:19.853
chop her into
tiny little pieces...

173
00:16:19.887 --> 00:16:21.514
and feed her to the birds.

174
00:16:21.555 --> 00:16:25.514
No. I want her to suffer.

175
00:16:33.653 --> 00:16:34.620
Let's see here.

176
00:16:34.654 --> 00:16:38.954
If I subtract the cosine
from the inverted integer...

177
00:16:38.992 --> 00:16:43.258
then I can take the flangeler
and put that here.

178
00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:45.093
That's it!

179
00:16:45.132 --> 00:16:46.258
Of course!

180
00:16:48.543 --> 00:16:50.943
It's equal mass displacement!

181
00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:55.006
See, guys, for every one of us
that goes back...

182
00:16:55.049 --> 00:16:57.950
someone from the past
will come here.

183
00:16:57.986 --> 00:16:59.779
But the problem is...

184
00:16:59.876 --> 00:17:02.777
that switch will only work
under one condition.

185
00:17:02.812 --> 00:17:04.336
You know what that is?

186
00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:06.110
Tuesdays?

187
00:17:06.149 --> 00:17:08.014
Groundhog's Day?

188
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:10.383
Great.

189
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.548
It will only work
if the magic travelers...

190
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.922
each have the same weight.

191
00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:23.226
Bingo. Gee, you guys do have
a good educational system, huh?

192
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.628
Step back, dudes.

193
00:17:24.636 --> 00:17:27.662
I just brought us
some heavy artillery.

194
00:17:30.809 --> 00:17:31.867
Donny!

195
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.502
Long time!

196
00:17:33.545 --> 00:17:34.840
Leo, how's it going?

197
00:17:34.978 --> 00:17:37.112
Hey, Casey, welcome back.

198
00:17:37.177 --> 00:17:39.042
Hey, Raph, how'd your
brain implant go, good?

199
00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:42.343
What? Funny.

200
00:17:42.382 --> 00:17:46.409
Anyway, enough of this
camaraderie.

201
00:17:46.452 --> 00:17:49.319
When do we get together
and bust some skulls?

202
00:17:49.355 --> 00:17:50.686
Hold it there, Casey.

203
00:17:50.706 --> 00:17:53.197
You're not gonna do
any head-breaking this time.

204
00:17:53.242 --> 00:17:54.334
Sorry, guy.

205
00:17:54.376 --> 00:17:55.502
What was that?

206
00:17:55.544 --> 00:17:56.834
You want to run that
by me again?

207
00:17:56.894 --> 00:17:58.122
How come?

208
00:17:58.162 --> 00:18:00.326
'Cause we need somebody
to stay here with Splinter...

209
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:02.934
in case the time bandit
here decides to flip out.

210
00:18:03.033 --> 00:18:05.595
If it ain't too much
of an inconvenience.

211
00:18:08.873 --> 00:18:10.263
It'll be a serious honor.

212
00:18:10.308 --> 00:18:12.709
It is time to go, my sons.

213
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:16.722
Donatello, we shall wait
by the scepter...

214
00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:20.663
every twelve hours
as you have instructed.

215
00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:24.001
Correct, Master Splinter,
but the space-time continuum...

216
00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:26.050
will be out of phase
after sixty hours.

217
00:18:26.137 --> 00:18:27.695
Wait a second.
Time-out.

218
00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:30.105
What does all that mean
in American?

219
00:18:30.141 --> 00:18:32.234
If we don't come back
in 2 1/2 days...

220
00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.403
we're turtle soup.

221
00:18:34.612 --> 00:18:37.240
Bummer.

222
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.278
Why don't you get
a real job, cue ball?

223
00:18:53.153 --> 00:18:55.622
Hey, hey. You know what?
This is a Rolex.

224
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:57.278
It's a gold Rolex.
You want it?

225
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.015
Let me out of here!

226
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.429
If you stay with Walker,
you die.

227
00:19:12.513 --> 00:19:14.913
You come with me, you live.

228
00:19:14.949 --> 00:19:16.610
Lock him up, lads.

229
00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:25.621
You! Up, fool, up.

230
00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:33.691
Well, well, well.
What have we got here?

231
00:19:33.728 --> 00:19:38.324
Give us a kiss, duckling,
while you still got your lips.

232
00:19:40.668 --> 00:19:45.435
You're not the first one
to do that to me.

233
00:19:46.082 --> 00:19:48.346
There you are, Mr. Whit.

234
00:19:48.384 --> 00:19:51.376
You can lead your stinking
mutiny in here!

235
00:19:52.988 --> 00:19:55.752
Good night, me little
tweety birds.

236
00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.154
Come on, lads.

237
00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:02.968
Goodbye, Whit!

238
00:20:11.018 --> 00:20:12.349
Casey?

239
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.565
Yeah, you look familiar, too.

240
00:20:31.478 --> 00:20:33.878
The scepter will be
in the temple...

241
00:20:33.914 --> 00:20:37.345
which means you will be
replaced by four priests.

242
00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:38.705
Nothing to it.

243
00:20:38.742 --> 00:20:41.302
Now we must please try to hurry.

244
00:20:41.344 --> 00:20:43.410
Mitsu is in great danger.

245
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.439
Mits-who?

246
00:20:44.484 --> 00:20:47.551
Yes, Mitsu. She is
the woman who leads...

247
00:20:47.584 --> 00:20:48.949
the rebellion against my father.

248
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.189
She is the most courageous
and beautiful woman...

249
00:20:53.223 --> 00:20:57.216
Yeah, we get the picture.
Can we go now?

250
00:20:57.217 --> 00:20:58.411
Enough Mitsu already.

251
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:00.419
T-minus two minutes
and counting.

252
00:21:00.453 --> 00:21:01.784
Let's go, Mikey.

253
00:21:02.822 --> 00:21:03.811
What?

254
00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:10.775
Why are you wearing shorts?

255
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.677
Kenshin switched with April
and got her clothes.

256
00:21:13.713 --> 00:21:14.473
Yeah, so?

257
00:21:14.495 --> 00:21:17.464
So this is for whoever
comes through in my place...

258
00:21:17.498 --> 00:21:19.762
so they won't arrive
bare-butt naked.

259
00:21:21.035 --> 00:21:22.832
I got three more pairs.

260
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.497
No!

261
00:21:24.538 --> 00:21:28.998
We have no time for this
scientific debate.

262
00:21:29.043 --> 00:21:31.807
Yes, master.
Come on, guys, let's go.

263
00:21:31.846 --> 00:21:33.279
It's time.

264
00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:37.014
Kids.

265
00:21:37.852 --> 00:21:40.480
The inscription says,
"Open wide the gates of time."

266
00:21:40.521 --> 00:21:42.455
All right already.
Let's go!

267
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.756
Go with care, my sons,
and return with swiftness.

268
00:21:46.794 --> 00:21:49.285
We will not fail you,
Master Splinter.

269
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.696
OK, guys.
Hold on now.

270
00:21:51.732 --> 00:21:52.699
Here we go.

271
00:21:52.733 --> 00:21:54.792
It's starting to work.
Hang on!

272
00:22:05.346 --> 00:22:07.644
Make sure your tray tables...

273
00:22:07.682 --> 00:22:09.775
are in their full
upright positions!

274
00:22:09.817 --> 00:22:13.913
Hang on to your shells, dudes!

275
00:22:26.854 --> 00:22:28.583
This is very bad.

276
00:22:28.623 --> 00:22:30.056
They are not four priests.

277
00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:32.355
They are my father's
honor guard.

278
00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:35.021
The scepter was
not in the temple.

279
00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:36.331
There must have been a battle.

280
00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:38.185
I knew it.
I'm missing all the fun.

281
00:22:52.436 --> 00:22:55.234
Where are the priests?

282
00:22:55.272 --> 00:22:56.705
Where's the temple?

283
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:59.073
Talk about your quantum leap.

284
00:23:01.846 --> 00:23:04.076
Hey, dudes, check it out!

285
00:23:04.115 --> 00:23:05.412
We're in "Shogun"!

286
00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:11.445
Hey, where'd we get
these clothes?

287
00:23:11.484 --> 00:23:14.817
These guys are pretty serious.

288
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:21.551
How do you steer this thing?

289
00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:22.847
There's no steering
wheel on mine.

290
00:23:22.887 --> 00:23:24.980
You're lucky! Mine doesn't
even have a head!

291
00:23:25.022 --> 00:23:28.048
Watch out for the people!

292
00:23:36.772 --> 00:23:39.366
Don't these things
ever run out of gas?

293
00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:41.376
I think I swallowed a frog.

294
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.968
Hope it wasn't an ancestor.

295
00:23:43.012 --> 00:23:44.609
That was fun.

296
00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:47.045
Well, at least
the time travel worked.

297
00:23:47.081 --> 00:23:49.149
We're here five minutes,
and already we lost...

298
00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:51.162
one brother,
the magic scepter...

299
00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:52.220
Our dignity...

300
00:23:52.263 --> 00:23:54.322
And no April.

301
00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:56.391
Hey, where's Mikey?

302
00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:59.096
Last time I saw him,
he was doing this...

303
00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:02.770
Jeez, what else could happen?

304
00:24:02.807 --> 00:24:05.005
Whoa, Buttermilk!

305
00:24:05.024 --> 00:24:06.992
Good horsey! Good horsey!

306
00:24:08.128 --> 00:24:09.993
Who turned out the lights?

307
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:14.090
I think I saw this
on "Bonanza" once.

308
00:25:08.114 --> 00:25:11.675
OK, boys, who's first in line?

309
00:25:11.717 --> 00:25:13.275
Come on.

310
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.748
Ancient wusses.

311
00:25:23.295 --> 00:25:26.696
Even here, you find me.

312
00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:31.665
Put down your sword, Kenshin.

313
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.669
They are not enemies,
only lost warriors...

314
00:25:35.714 --> 00:25:36.806
like yourself.

315
00:25:46.058 --> 00:25:48.156
So far this disguise
has worked...

316
00:25:48.245 --> 00:25:50.345
but we're turtles,
not honor guards.

317
00:25:50.403 --> 00:25:51.594
Thanks for pointing
that out, Leo.

318
00:25:51.619 --> 00:25:54.213
That would explain
the large shell on my back.

319
00:25:54.255 --> 00:25:56.246
Well, you don't have
to be so sarcastic.

320
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.724
Well, I'm sorry, Leo,
but that's my nature.

321
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:07.589
You see, Walker,
we do not need your help.

322
00:26:07.635 --> 00:26:10.133
We're victorious
without your guns.

323
00:26:10.197 --> 00:26:13.700
Today my honor guard carried
my own secret weapon.

324
00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:16.283
Really? Well,
that's very good news.

325
00:26:16.317 --> 00:26:18.649
Where are my honor guards?

326
00:26:18.686 --> 00:26:21.678
Murata, find my honor guards.

327
00:26:21.722 --> 00:26:22.689
Yes!

328
00:26:22.723 --> 00:26:24.247
Now! Right away!

329
00:26:29.697 --> 00:26:30.686
You!

330
00:26:31.766 --> 00:26:34.234
Come here. Now!

331
00:26:34.268 --> 00:26:36.737
I told you these outfits
would get us into trouble.

332
00:26:36.822 --> 00:26:37.789
Let's go.
Blend in.

333
00:26:37.823 --> 00:26:38.790
Yeah, right.

334
00:26:38.824 --> 00:26:40.655
They're coming.

335
00:26:40.693 --> 00:26:42.092
They're behind the wagon.

336
00:26:42.128 --> 00:26:43.527
Step aside!

337
00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:49.225
Where are they?

338
00:26:51.337 --> 00:26:53.032
Go! Idiot!

339
00:26:56.275 --> 00:26:59.472
It's very impressive, my lord.

340
00:26:59.512 --> 00:27:01.104
This is very bad.

341
00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:05.006
Well, they fell for it.

342
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.304
Shh! Keep it down, Leo.

343
00:27:07.343 --> 00:27:08.867
So they've gone missing.

344
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:11.141
I mean, war does have a habit
of doing that to people.

345
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.609
It's time to look to the future.

346
00:27:12.648 --> 00:27:14.612
You do not understand.
My honor guard carried...

347
00:27:14.712 --> 00:27:16.703
a sacred family relic
to ensure victory.

348
00:27:16.747 --> 00:27:18.840
Ah, yes, the golden scepter.

349
00:27:18.882 --> 00:27:20.611
Well, one does hear things.

350
00:27:20.651 --> 00:27:25.816
Secrets leak like
a stink from a dead pig.

351
00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:28.791
You certainly can
turn a phrase, my lord.

352
00:27:28.826 --> 00:27:30.924
Listen to me, Daimyo.
Guns ensure victory...

353
00:27:30.987 --> 00:27:32.887
not some ancestral
good-luck charm.

354
00:27:32.922 --> 00:27:33.911
You are wrong.

355
00:27:33.957 --> 00:27:35.052
If the scepter's lost,
my clan is lost...

356
00:27:35.152 --> 00:27:36.176
and you, Walker,
will have no one...

357
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:40.519
to trade with but yourself.

358
00:27:40.557 --> 00:27:42.115
Niles!

359
00:27:46.363 --> 00:27:47.295
Captain?

360
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.855
Bring me the woman.

361
00:27:52.673 --> 00:27:54.834
Come on, guys.
Let's find the temple.

362
00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:56.308
Maybe April's still in there.

363
00:27:56.343 --> 00:27:59.938
Boy, Kenshin's dad
must be seriously rich.

364
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.345
I think I saw this place...

365
00:28:01.382 --> 00:28:03.350
on "Lifestyles of the
Rich and Dangerous."

366
00:28:03.384 --> 00:28:05.716
"Bring me the woman, Niles."

367
00:28:05.753 --> 00:28:07.146
"Lick my boots, Niles."

368
00:28:07.188 --> 00:28:08.746
"Feed my birds, Niles."

369
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.418
What's next,
roll over and play dead?

370
00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:14.690
What are you looking at,
you ugly lump of dung?

371
00:28:14.729 --> 00:28:15.718
What?

372
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:21.234
Dung, huh?

373
00:28:26.441 --> 00:28:29.899
You dirty... I oughta...

374
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.717
Later, Popeye.

375
00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:33.719
I'm going to get that guy!

376
00:28:33.753 --> 00:28:35.618
You hear what he called me, Leo?

377
00:28:35.655 --> 00:28:37.418
Yeah, an ugly lump of dung.

378
00:28:37.457 --> 00:28:40.620
Well, that was an insult, Leo.

379
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.718
Not necessarily, Raph.

380
00:28:41.813 --> 00:28:43.144
Did you know that
in some countries...

381
00:28:43.181 --> 00:28:45.149
dung is used as a fuel source?

382
00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:49.186
Thanks, Don.

383
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.653
Hi-o, wasabi.

384
00:28:50.688 --> 00:28:52.622
Hello, mustard?

385
00:28:52.657 --> 00:28:55.558
OK, so my Japanese
is a little rusty.

386
00:28:55.593 --> 00:28:57.855
Suzuki, Kawasaki.

387
00:28:58.056 --> 00:28:59.916
How about sayonara?

388
00:29:00.053 --> 00:29:01.953
- That'll work.
- Ciao.

389
00:29:01.989 --> 00:29:03.786
- Adios.
- See you later.

390
00:29:09.396 --> 00:29:12.456
It's me again, Fatso-san.

391
00:29:12.499 --> 00:29:14.160
Open up.

392
00:29:14.201 --> 00:29:16.533
Hurry up!

393
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.084
Woman!

394
00:29:21.128 --> 00:29:25.758
We want woman.

395
00:29:27.334 --> 00:29:29.029
Move it, you sot!

396
00:29:29.069 --> 00:29:32.038
He's not man enough
to do anything.

397
00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:35.936
There they are...

398
00:29:35.976 --> 00:29:36.937
the Three Stooges.

399
00:29:36.943 --> 00:29:39.537
Larry, Curly, and Moe.

400
00:29:40.138 --> 00:29:42.231
Get her down, you fat sot!

401
00:29:42.273 --> 00:29:44.241
Beat it.
See you later.

402
00:29:44.275 --> 00:29:46.835
Don't ruffle
me little duck's feathers.

403
00:29:46.878 --> 00:29:48.573
I want her for myself.

404
00:29:50.882 --> 00:29:52.213
Hurry up!

405
00:29:56.087 --> 00:29:58.681
It's wet willy time, Moe.

406
00:29:58.723 --> 00:30:01.817
Wet... what-um?

407
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.664
What a maroon!

408
00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:07.970
Hey, what's up, April?

409
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:08.977
Oh, hi, April.

410
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:09.978
Yo, April.

411
00:30:10.012 --> 00:30:12.276
Raph? Leo?

412
00:30:12.314 --> 00:30:15.443
Boy, some vacation!
I'd fire my travel agent.

413
00:30:15.511 --> 00:30:16.478
Not me.
I think it's cool.

414
00:30:16.512 --> 00:30:17.536
Hey, fat boy.

415
00:30:25.655 --> 00:30:27.482
Yeah, get him in there.

416
00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:30.314
Hey, don't forget
to pack a lunch.

417
00:30:30.352 --> 00:30:32.377
As a matter of fact, pack three.

418
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.820
Wow, he can actually
lift that thing.

419
00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:35.982
That's impressive.

420
00:30:36.024 --> 00:30:36.991
Hey, hello?

421
00:30:37.025 --> 00:30:38.458
Nice clothes, April.

422
00:30:38.493 --> 00:30:40.120
What? Would somebody
please tell me...

423
00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:42.106
what the heck is
going on around here?

424
00:30:42.141 --> 00:30:43.938
Well, relax, April.

425
00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:45.409
It's just your ordinary...

426
00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:47.808
time-travel-equal-mass-
displacement kind of thing.

427
00:30:47.962 --> 00:30:48.951
Yeah, what he said.

428
00:30:49.997 --> 00:30:52.830
So let's get out of here... now!

429
00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:56.796
Be nice, brave miss!

430
00:30:56.837 --> 00:30:59.897
Miss, cut me loose.
They'll hang me here.

431
00:31:00.936 --> 00:31:04.167
This is my favorite part!

432
00:31:04.206 --> 00:31:05.195
Come on!

433
00:31:08.544 --> 00:31:10.375
Next.

434
00:31:17.611 --> 00:31:20.079
I know I'm going to regret this.

435
00:31:20.114 --> 00:31:21.741
Hey, come and get me. Come on!

436
00:31:21.782 --> 00:31:23.215
Watch your head.

437
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.343
Well, come on! Hurry!

438
00:31:38.136 --> 00:31:39.603
Hey, think these guys...

439
00:31:39.637 --> 00:31:42.401
have ever seen
a pinball machine before?

440
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.408
Watch. Throw them to me.

441
00:31:44.442 --> 00:31:45.636
Boing! Tilt!

442
00:31:48.376 --> 00:31:50.344
Fight's over.
We're closed.

443
00:31:50.378 --> 00:31:53.040
These guys are really pushy.

444
00:31:53.081 --> 00:31:54.508
They don't know when to quit.

445
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:55.448
What are you doing, April?

446
00:31:55.529 --> 00:31:57.497
Come on! I think
I found a way out.

447
00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:01.233
Obviously not
the age of chivalry.

448
00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.381
Come on!

449
00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:05.252
Go! We're right behind you!

450
00:32:09.589 --> 00:32:10.920
Not another sewer!

451
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.949
I'll be back.

452
00:32:23.703 --> 00:32:25.864
Garbage!

453
00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:33.713
Boy, do I hate spinach.

454
00:32:36.045 --> 00:32:37.034
Raph?

455
00:32:40.883 --> 00:32:42.976
Well...

456
00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:46.113
I'm in there. Donny?

457
00:32:56.098 --> 00:33:01.058
Mud wrestling is definitely
a spectator sport.

458
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.535
Gross.

459
00:33:03.576 --> 00:33:04.543
Grosser.

460
00:33:04.577 --> 00:33:06.238
April!

461
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.769
Here.

462
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.683
Help me up.

463
00:33:11.908 --> 00:33:13.375
All right. I'm coming.
On my way over.

464
00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:15.377
A little mud, no problem.

465
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:16.400
Help me.

466
00:33:19.415 --> 00:33:22.077
Wait, wait.
I'm getting...

467
00:33:22.118 --> 00:33:25.849
This was the worst rescue
I have ever had.

468
00:33:25.888 --> 00:33:28.413
Help! I'm a turtle,
and I can't get up!

469
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.391
Thanks.

470
00:33:31.517 --> 00:33:32.779
We'd better get out of here.

471
00:33:32.818 --> 00:33:34.443
Look on the bright side, April.

472
00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:37.359
We could've fallen into a big,
greasy, smelly pile of...

473
00:33:37.394 --> 00:33:39.385
Don't even say it, Don!

474
00:33:46.503 --> 00:33:47.868
Hello?

475
00:34:06.382 --> 00:34:07.576
Oh, hello.

476
00:34:07.616 --> 00:34:09.777
Oh, that hurts.

477
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.588
What a head popper!

478
00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:19.753
Boy! Earth to me.

479
00:34:24.568 --> 00:34:27.731
God, my neck hurts.
My spots hurt.

480
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:30.399
Even my bandanna hurts.

481
00:34:31.442 --> 00:34:33.171
Hey, little one.

482
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:38.949
Hey, where am I?

483
00:34:38.983 --> 00:34:41.679
Mikey!

484
00:34:43.118 --> 00:34:46.144
Yo, Michaelangelo!

485
00:34:46.188 --> 00:34:48.986
Hey, Mikey!

486
00:34:54.376 --> 00:34:55.673
Much better.

487
00:34:56.912 --> 00:34:59.346
- A leg-o-rama.
- Yeah, I'll say.

488
00:34:59.381 --> 00:35:03.215
Hey! I'm allowed.
I'm on vacation.

489
00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:04.842
Right.

490
00:35:04.884 --> 00:35:07.375
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

491
00:35:07.419 --> 00:35:09.148
- Schwing!
- Schwing!

492
00:35:20.933 --> 00:35:23.902
Hey, Leo.
Look at this water.

493
00:35:24.025 --> 00:35:25.515
I don't see anything.

494
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.425
Exactly!

495
00:35:27.462 --> 00:35:32.798
No tires, no beer cans,
no dead fish...

496
00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:35.098
just water...

497
00:35:35.136 --> 00:35:38.663
clean, clear,
beautiful water.

498
00:35:41.777 --> 00:35:45.611
Nature! I love it!
Makes me want to...

499
00:35:45.647 --> 00:35:48.047
I don't know,
migrate or something.

500
00:35:50.152 --> 00:35:53.713
Turtles don't migrate, Raph.
Birds do.

501
00:35:53.755 --> 00:35:56.986
Hey, I got a beak, don't I?

502
00:35:57.388 --> 00:36:00.653
- OK, turtles, let's move out.
- You bet.

503
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.091
Ambush!

504
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.963
Here comes trouble, guys.

505
00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:26.375
One... and a two!

506
00:36:31.046 --> 00:36:33.514
Enjoy your swim, fellas.

507
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.811
Miss me?

508
00:36:51.307 --> 00:36:53.707
You like baseball here?

509
00:36:53.743 --> 00:36:55.870
Strike one!
Strike two!

510
00:36:55.912 --> 00:36:57.379
You're out of there.

511
00:36:57.413 --> 00:36:58.846
I love that game.

512
00:36:58.882 --> 00:37:01.442
OK. I've had enough.

513
00:37:05.054 --> 00:37:07.284
Come on, Jack!

514
00:37:07.323 --> 00:37:10.019
It's hammer time.

515
00:37:11.317 --> 00:37:12.807
Missed!

516
00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:22.730
Here, hold these.
Thank you.

517
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:24.933
Dance?

518
00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:39.757
What?

519
00:37:44.867 --> 00:37:47.893
No, no, no, lady.
That ain't nice.

520
00:37:56.446 --> 00:37:58.173
Hey, who blew the whistle?

521
00:37:58.264 --> 00:38:00.459
Hey, look!

522
00:38:03.261 --> 00:38:05.320
Hey, we're friends.

523
00:38:05.363 --> 00:38:08.332
We're here to find
our brother, that's all.

524
00:38:10.034 --> 00:38:13.162
Hey, I don't kiss
on the first date, lady.

525
00:38:13.204 --> 00:38:15.195
Raph, give it a rest, will you?

526
00:38:16.574 --> 00:38:18.269
Don't be afraid.

527
00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.363
You are just like
the other one.

528
00:38:24.388 --> 00:38:25.377
Say what?

529
00:38:25.422 --> 00:38:26.389
The other one?

530
00:38:26.423 --> 00:38:27.447
Mikey?

531
00:38:27.491 --> 00:38:29.482
- What?
- Bingo!

532
00:38:31.595 --> 00:38:32.584
Most excellent!

533
00:38:33.609 --> 00:38:35.270
Get down with
your turtle self.

534
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.380
They say your friends
are devils or demons.

535
00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:03.188
Hey, pal, you got
a relative in Brooklyn?

536
00:39:04.338 --> 00:39:06.338
I figure they're mercenaries
in disguise...

537
00:39:06.464 --> 00:39:08.558
come to help the rebels.

538
00:39:08.687 --> 00:39:10.120
Invaders from the north.

539
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.155
My village!

540
00:39:21.733 --> 00:39:24.167
Mikey!

541
00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:33.663
Find Kenshin!

542
00:39:33.703 --> 00:39:36.797
Fire over their heads and burn
this place to the ground!

543
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.240
There's a reward for the man
who brings me the scepter!

544
00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:40.937
Go!

545
00:39:42.282 --> 00:39:43.271
Burn it!

546
00:39:49.356 --> 00:39:50.516
Go!

547
00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.560
Yoshi!

548
00:39:58.498 --> 00:40:00.032
Gunfire?

549
00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:02.166
Better cover the melon.

550
00:40:02.208 --> 00:40:04.699
I got to get out of here!

551
00:40:11.998 --> 00:40:14.159
Burn it to the ground!

552
00:40:18.204 --> 00:40:20.570
It's one of them honor guards.

553
00:40:20.607 --> 00:40:23.098
There's a reward for him.

554
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.271
Greetings from Her Majesty.

555
00:40:33.919 --> 00:40:36.945
My heroes!

556
00:40:38.924 --> 00:40:40.349
Wait!

557
00:40:40.446 --> 00:40:43.108
I'm really a beautiful princess
in disguise.

558
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:44.411
Oh, swords.

559
00:40:46.452 --> 00:40:48.386
Break the spell!

560
00:40:48.421 --> 00:40:51.049
Give me a kiss!

561
00:40:52.258 --> 00:40:53.225
A monster!

562
00:40:53.259 --> 00:40:54.226
What?

563
00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.227
Bright green!

564
00:40:55.261 --> 00:40:57.525
What do you mean, a monster?

565
00:40:57.563 --> 00:40:59.758
Which way did they go?

566
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.903
Excuse me, Niles.

567
00:41:01.938 --> 00:41:03.970
Shouldn't you be trying
to scare somebody?

568
00:41:04.009 --> 00:41:05.772
But there's a demon
up the road, Captain...

569
00:41:05.811 --> 00:41:08.075
a wild beast
with the body of a man...

570
00:41:08.114 --> 00:41:09.775
and the head
of the devil himself.

571
00:41:09.815 --> 00:41:11.710
Listen to me,
you cretinous idiot...

572
00:41:11.773 --> 00:41:13.240
it's nothing but a Samurai...

573
00:41:13.274 --> 00:41:14.707
wearing one of his
ridiculous masks.

574
00:41:14.742 --> 00:41:16.607
- But...
- Shut up!

575
00:41:16.644 --> 00:41:18.168
Get on with it!

576
00:41:22.517 --> 00:41:25.384
What the...

577
00:41:27.173 --> 00:41:29.801
Clint Eastwood?

578
00:41:47.677 --> 00:41:48.869
Hey, Butch.

579
00:41:48.912 --> 00:41:50.903
Don't you know
westerns are dead?

580
00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:53.074
Speaking of dead...

581
00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.508
I'll save you, Captain.

582
00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:04.112
Hi there.

583
00:42:04.185 --> 00:42:05.516
You see, when I said
westerns were dead...

584
00:42:05.553 --> 00:42:07.043
what I meant was, uh...
well, they're not dead.

585
00:42:07.088 --> 00:42:08.487
'cause I forgot about Clint.

586
00:42:08.522 --> 00:42:11.252
You look a lot like Clint,
yes, you do.

587
00:42:12.827 --> 00:42:13.816
Wet willy.

588
00:42:15.263 --> 00:42:17.197
Sorry, Captain!

589
00:42:21.168 --> 00:42:24.729
Dudes!
Most excellent timing!

590
00:42:33.748 --> 00:42:35.113
Split up!

591
00:42:43.913 --> 00:42:46.711
Hold it right there, Zorro dude!

592
00:42:57.013 --> 00:42:58.378
He's getting away!

593
00:43:05.488 --> 00:43:06.455
Wimp!

594
00:43:06.489 --> 00:43:08.286
Captain, don't leave me here!

595
00:43:09.959 --> 00:43:11.449
Wait for...

596
00:43:13.477 --> 00:43:17.413
Help! Grandfather, help!

597
00:43:17.447 --> 00:43:20.547
- Yoshi!
- Help!

598
00:43:20.627 --> 00:43:22.219
- Grandfather, help!
- Easy, easy.

599
00:43:22.262 --> 00:43:23.320
Yoshi!

600
00:43:23.363 --> 00:43:24.557
Grandson!

601
00:43:26.399 --> 00:43:27.889
Stay right here.

602
00:43:41.733 --> 00:43:43.360
I don't think I'm cut out
for this hero stuff.

603
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:44.766
Michaelangelo!

604
00:43:44.802 --> 00:43:47.327
Drink some water.

605
00:43:47.372 --> 00:43:48.930
What's going on?

606
00:43:50.012 --> 00:43:53.038
Well, here I go!

607
00:43:53.082 --> 00:43:54.709
I don't believe it!
He went in!

608
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.547
Mikey, no!

609
00:44:06.596 --> 00:44:08.723
We've got to do something!

610
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.862
Kurt Russell,
eat your heart out.

611
00:44:20.372 --> 00:44:22.636
I think he's going to be OK.

612
00:44:33.024 --> 00:44:34.491
Are you all right?

613
00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:35.953
You scared me half to death.

614
00:44:35.996 --> 00:44:38.328
Scared me half to death.

615
00:44:43.737 --> 00:44:46.433
I can't believe you did that!
You're a hero!

616
00:44:46.473 --> 00:44:48.168
He has no life in him!

617
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.377
What's going on?

618
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.921
Give him to me.

619
00:44:53.966 --> 00:44:56.093
Let me take him, please.

620
00:44:58.003 --> 00:44:59.834
Keep everyone back.

621
00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:00.963
Stay back, everyone.

622
00:45:01.006 --> 00:45:02.098
Give the guy some room.

623
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.539
- Give me some room.
- Give him some room!

624
00:45:03.575 --> 00:45:05.202
Everybody get back.

625
00:45:17.426 --> 00:45:19.986
No, wait.
Let him try.

626
00:45:20.029 --> 00:45:22.725
No! He's casting an evil spell.

627
00:45:22.765 --> 00:45:25.256
No, it's not an evil spell.
He's helping.

628
00:45:25.796 --> 00:45:29.163
Keep back, everyone.
I need more time.

629
00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:32.849
Help him out.

630
00:45:34.028 --> 00:45:36.519
Come on, Leo. You can do it.

631
00:45:50.284 --> 00:45:55.381
One, two, three, four, five.

632
00:45:55.422 --> 00:45:57.652
One, two, three...

633
00:46:00.861 --> 00:46:02.886
That a boy, Leo.

634
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.262
- He did it!
- All right!

635
00:46:14.154 --> 00:46:16.418
You're going to be OK, Yoshi.

636
00:46:20.493 --> 00:46:22.620
Here you go.

637
00:46:29.402 --> 00:46:32.735
- Outstanding, dude!
- Thanks.

638
00:46:33.321 --> 00:46:36.950
I just hope these village people
won't be afraid of us anymore.

639
00:46:50.471 --> 00:46:53.099
Well, it's a start.

640
00:46:56.644 --> 00:47:00.045
Your men showed
lack of courage today.

641
00:47:00.081 --> 00:47:03.581
They were frightened
by the demons, as were your men.

642
00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:05.651
Is that so?

643
00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.291
Walker...

644
00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.850
Look.

645
00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:14.763
Tell me...

646
00:47:14.943 --> 00:47:17.275
were the demons today not men?

647
00:47:17.312 --> 00:47:20.110
Real demons?

648
00:47:20.148 --> 00:47:21.775
I don't know.

649
00:47:21.816 --> 00:47:30.315
Old priests say once before,
demons defeated my ancestors.

650
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.611
Now they've come back for me.

651
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:41.684
I agree to your price.

652
00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:44.559
Guns for silver and silk.

653
00:47:44.954 --> 00:47:46.922
Guns for gold.

654
00:47:46.956 --> 00:47:49.686
Now there are demons.
Before there were just men.

655
00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:55.422
My cannons can destroy
these monsters, my lord.

656
00:47:55.464 --> 00:47:57.591
You can rewrite history.

657
00:48:11.145 --> 00:48:13.739
And I can rewrite you.

658
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:16.978
Clothesline!

659
00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:21.645
Wipeout!

660
00:48:21.681 --> 00:48:23.273
Hi-yo, Silver!

661
00:48:24.984 --> 00:48:26.144
Oh, horse.

662
00:48:29.289 --> 00:48:30.381
Hey, horsey!

663
00:48:31.146 --> 00:48:34.081
Somebody dial 911.
Medic!

664
00:48:35.216 --> 00:48:36.513
You thirsty?

665
00:48:37.852 --> 00:48:39.012
My butt.

666
00:48:40.195 --> 00:48:41.890
You didn't find
the scepter, did you?

667
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:43.864
Nah. It's history.

668
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:49.728
Adios, amigos.

669
00:48:49.772 --> 00:48:53.003
You know, sometimes
I hate that guy.

670
00:48:55.121 --> 00:48:56.010
Let's see...

671
00:48:56.042 --> 00:48:59.443
Wait. Let's just
hold it here, OK?

672
00:48:59.479 --> 00:49:01.037
If the scepter
wasn't in the woods...

673
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.545
maybe the Daimyo has it.

674
00:49:02.636 --> 00:49:04.797
No. He's been
looking for it, too.

675
00:49:04.838 --> 00:49:06.635
So what are we going to do?

676
00:49:06.673 --> 00:49:08.637
How are we going to get home?

677
00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:10.331
Wait!
Fellas, listen.

678
00:49:10.365 --> 00:49:12.466
Are you sure this isn't
a dumb thing to do?

679
00:49:12.512 --> 00:49:14.275
No, it's a smart thing to do.

680
00:49:14.314 --> 00:49:16.942
Losing the old scepter
was a dumb thing to do.

681
00:49:16.984 --> 00:49:18.474
I didn't lose it, OK?

682
00:49:27.661 --> 00:49:29.390
Excuse me.

683
00:49:32.499 --> 00:49:34.194
What?

684
00:49:34.283 --> 00:49:36.877
I don't mean to spoil
your little party here.

685
00:49:40.854 --> 00:49:42.481
This is your plan?

686
00:49:43.944 --> 00:49:45.673
You don't mean... you're
not seriously suggesting...

687
00:49:45.712 --> 00:49:47.111
that Donatello is
going to make...

688
00:49:47.147 --> 00:49:49.615
an incredibly arcane time
travel machine, are you?

689
00:49:52.185 --> 00:49:53.152
Totally bogus.

690
00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:54.710
Really stupid.

691
00:49:54.755 --> 00:49:55.845
Well, that's a relief.

692
00:49:55.884 --> 00:49:57.875
No, that guy's going to make it.

693
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.452
He's good with his hands.

694
00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:05.281
What?

695
00:50:06.294 --> 00:50:07.594
Come on, April.

696
00:50:07.612 --> 00:50:09.079
Where are you going?

697
00:50:09.918 --> 00:50:11.783
To find an apartment.

698
00:50:12.657 --> 00:50:13.550
I have a feeling...

699
00:50:13.608 --> 00:50:16.236
we're going to be here
for a very long time.

700
00:50:16.278 --> 00:50:18.709
- An apartment?
- Are there apartments in Japan?

701
00:50:18.746 --> 00:50:19.940
What do I look like,
a real estate agent?

702
00:50:19.981 --> 00:50:22.176
What about condos
and time-shares?

703
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.811
Take me with you.

704
00:50:38.855 --> 00:50:40.755
Where? New York?

705
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:43.016
No. You wouldn't fit in.

706
00:50:43.021 --> 00:50:46.889
I mean... well, actually,
you would fit in.

707
00:50:46.925 --> 00:50:49.155
But you wouldn't
really fit in...

708
00:50:49.194 --> 00:50:50.422
you know what I mean?

709
00:50:50.462 --> 00:50:51.724
You could teach me.

710
00:50:51.763 --> 00:50:53.663
No, I couldn't.

711
00:50:54.465 --> 00:50:59.869
Look, Whit... l'm going back
real soon and...

712
00:51:00.971 --> 00:51:03.633
I don't want to have
this conversation, OK?

713
00:51:16.841 --> 00:51:19.366
Take whatever you guys
need, all right?

714
00:51:25.466 --> 00:51:26.224
Hey, Ken.

715
00:51:26.318 --> 00:51:28.343
Maybe you ought to try
a little decaf?

716
00:51:28.387 --> 00:51:30.446
Kenshin is unhappy.

717
00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:34.152
He believes they will
never get home.

718
00:51:34.193 --> 00:51:36.354
It ain't exactly
a quick jaunt...

719
00:51:36.395 --> 00:51:38.124
across the Brooklyn Bridge,
is it?

720
00:51:42.701 --> 00:51:43.932
Hey, Ken.

721
00:51:43.955 --> 00:51:45.479
You know, maybe you
ought to try...

722
00:51:45.523 --> 00:51:47.184
a little herbal, Ken-man,
know what I mean?

723
00:51:47.225 --> 00:51:51.889
We can't wait for your sons!
Mitsu needs me now.

724
00:51:55.133 --> 00:51:56.464
The scepter.

725
00:51:56.501 --> 00:51:57.934
Please!

726
00:52:13.909 --> 00:52:15.376
Can you believe it?

727
00:52:15.411 --> 00:52:19.177
We're not even
in the playoffs yet.

728
00:52:19.215 --> 00:52:20.443
The space-time continuum...

729
00:52:20.483 --> 00:52:24.544
will be out of phase
after sixty hours.

730
00:52:24.687 --> 00:52:26.251
Pick up the pace, Smithy-san.

731
00:52:26.336 --> 00:52:28.736
We gotta have that scepter
done by tonight.

732
00:52:30.273 --> 00:52:31.740
No.

733
00:52:33.644 --> 00:52:34.770
What?

734
00:52:37.014 --> 00:52:38.447
You know, there is one...

735
00:52:38.482 --> 00:52:40.813
O sole mio

736
00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:42.654
We're talking franchises
here, bud.

737
00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.853
All you got to do
is keep your delivery...

738
00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.388
to under thirty minutes.

739
00:52:46.477 --> 00:52:48.911
Let's see what we got here.

740
00:52:52.451 --> 00:52:53.418
Pizza.

741
00:52:53.452 --> 00:52:54.885
Got that, dude?

742
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.717
Pizza.

743
00:53:02.427 --> 00:53:05.590
Frisbee. Also cool.

744
00:53:08.486 --> 00:53:10.681
Who frisbeed me in the face?

745
00:53:10.721 --> 00:53:11.813
I'm out of here.

746
00:53:11.856 --> 00:53:13.551
Why, I ought to...

747
00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:18.692
It was Mike with the thing
and the lady.

748
00:53:33.327 --> 00:53:34.794
Hey, chill.

749
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:36.997
What is this,
the Geraldo Show?

750
00:53:37.056 --> 00:53:39.684
You got to learn to control
that temper, guy.

751
00:53:39.726 --> 00:53:41.990
Did I say that?

752
00:53:42.028 --> 00:53:44.463
We're practicing
fighting the Daimyo.

753
00:53:44.546 --> 00:53:45.808
Fight the Daimyo?

754
00:53:45.847 --> 00:53:47.178
Hold on here.

755
00:53:47.215 --> 00:53:48.682
Fighting's for grown-ups...

756
00:53:48.716 --> 00:53:51.583
and that's only if you
got no other choice.

757
00:53:51.619 --> 00:53:54.782
You guys are kids.
You should be out...

758
00:53:54.822 --> 00:53:58.383
you should be out having fun,
flying those things.

759
00:53:58.426 --> 00:54:00.422
Come on. We can do it together.

760
00:54:00.498 --> 00:54:01.988
You could teach me.

761
00:54:02.033 --> 00:54:03.466
Fun is for children.

762
00:54:03.501 --> 00:54:05.963
And what, you're
a senior citizen?

763
00:54:06.033 --> 00:54:07.398
Come on!

764
00:54:07.434 --> 00:54:08.696
It'll be easy.

765
00:54:08.736 --> 00:54:10.670
What did you say your name was?

766
00:54:10.704 --> 00:54:11.693
Yoshi.

767
00:54:15.209 --> 00:54:18.178
You and your buddies
grab those kites...

768
00:54:18.212 --> 00:54:20.737
and I'll join you later.

769
00:54:23.584 --> 00:54:26.280
Kids.

770
00:54:31.691 --> 00:54:33.420
Yoshi! Wait up!

771
00:54:38.198 --> 00:54:40.098
Hey! I think I'm getting this.

772
00:54:40.133 --> 00:54:41.498
Yoshi, what do you think?

773
00:54:41.534 --> 00:54:42.558
Look at that.

774
00:55:13.032 --> 00:55:15.195
Lord Norinaga
accepts your price.

775
00:55:15.232 --> 00:55:16.756
Guns for gold.

776
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.701
Tell the Daimyo
to prepare the papers.

777
00:55:43.811 --> 00:55:45.335
Sorry.

778
00:55:45.379 --> 00:55:48.780
I guess you want
to be alone, huh?

779
00:55:48.816 --> 00:55:52.616
I was asking the gods
to protect someone.

780
00:55:52.653 --> 00:55:54.348
Kenshin?

781
00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:59.657
He's, like, your beau, huh?

782
00:55:59.693 --> 00:56:01.422
You know him?

783
00:56:01.462 --> 00:56:02.427
Sort of.

784
00:56:02.513 --> 00:56:07.246
He kinda went on a cosmic cruise
and dropped in on us.

785
00:56:07.284 --> 00:56:09.252
But don't worry.
He'll be back...

786
00:56:09.286 --> 00:56:11.982
as soon as we leave.
I promise.

787
00:56:12.022 --> 00:56:14.183
How do you know this?

788
00:56:14.224 --> 00:56:16.021
Well...

789
00:56:16.948 --> 00:56:19.143
it's a kappa kind of thing.

790
00:56:23.535 --> 00:56:27.403
So... what's your sign?

791
00:56:47.478 --> 00:56:48.809
Man!

792
00:56:50.614 --> 00:56:52.673
- Hockey.
- Hockey.

793
00:56:52.716 --> 00:56:55.708
I guess it's time for
a little cultural exchange...

794
00:56:55.753 --> 00:56:57.846
if you know what I mean.

795
00:56:59.723 --> 00:57:01.350
OK, guys.

796
00:57:01.392 --> 00:57:03.826
Let's play a little hockey.

797
00:57:03.861 --> 00:57:04.850
Hockey?

798
00:57:09.828 --> 00:57:11.455
Take your best shot.

799
00:57:12.187 --> 00:57:14.587
Come on.

800
00:57:14.623 --> 00:57:16.687
Just like you saw on TV.

801
00:57:16.792 --> 00:57:17.781
Remember?

802
00:57:21.763 --> 00:57:22.752
Hey. Good.

803
00:57:23.932 --> 00:57:25.229
All right.

804
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:50.244
OK. I can work with that.

805
00:58:29.455 --> 00:58:31.252
Good.

806
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:35.192
Tomorrow, Walker,
we will use your guns.

807
00:58:35.227 --> 00:58:37.991
My pleasure.

808
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:39.520
Walker.

809
00:58:40.791 --> 00:58:45.251
My dungeon's very crowded.

810
00:58:45.891 --> 00:58:47.381
Well, then it would
only be humane...

811
00:58:47.426 --> 00:58:50.190
not to take any more
prisoners then, wouldn't it?

812
00:58:50.229 --> 00:58:53.323
You'll just have to kill
everybody.

813
00:58:56.378 --> 00:59:01.745
- What do you hear, sensei?
- Danger.

814
00:59:02.361 --> 00:59:04.852
Mitsu.

815
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:09.021
What is it?

816
00:59:09.065 --> 00:59:11.727
Mitsu, I bring bad news
from the castle.

817
00:59:12.369 --> 00:59:13.996
It's two hours to midnight.

818
00:59:14.037 --> 00:59:16.562
I sure hope this works.

819
00:59:16.606 --> 00:59:18.073
Yes.

820
00:59:18.108 --> 00:59:19.266
Why, this is perfect.

821
00:59:19.321 --> 00:59:20.846
What if this doesn't
work, dudes?

822
00:59:20.898 --> 00:59:23.196
What if we make like
a cosmic U-turn...

823
00:59:23.234 --> 00:59:25.634
and end up back
in Godzilla land?

824
00:59:25.669 --> 00:59:28.638
We don't have a choice,
unless you want to stay here.

825
00:59:28.672 --> 00:59:30.162
Well, maybe we should.

826
00:59:30.207 --> 00:59:31.297
Hold it.

827
00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.220
Yeah, right. Now,
forget about Mitsu...

828
00:59:33.255 --> 00:59:34.279
and give me the scepter
before you...

829
00:59:34.323 --> 00:59:35.847
Hey! Raph!

830
00:59:35.891 --> 00:59:37.381
Give me back the scepter...

831
00:59:37.426 --> 00:59:39.121
Give it over here!

832
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:44.090
- Nice going.
- Butterfingers.

833
00:59:45.835 --> 00:59:47.393
What next?

834
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.219
The Daimyo is coming
in the morning...

835
00:59:55.102 --> 00:59:57.569
with Walker and guns.

836
00:59:57.644 --> 00:59:58.668
Great.

837
00:59:59.913 --> 01:00:02.211
Oh, God, man.

838
01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.172
Hey, Yoshi.
You awake, buddy?

839
01:00:18.837 --> 01:00:20.930
What's the matter,
little man?

840
01:00:20.973 --> 01:00:22.565
What's up with those tears?

841
01:00:22.608 --> 01:00:24.132
What's going on here?

842
01:00:24.176 --> 01:00:25.734
Nothing.

843
01:00:25.778 --> 01:00:28.542
Nothing, huh?
Well, too bad.

844
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.979
'Cause if something
was bothering you...

845
01:00:30.015 --> 01:00:33.007
I got a little present
here to cheer you up.

846
01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:35.144
It's called a yo-yo.

847
01:00:35.187 --> 01:00:37.049
It's yours.
I made it for you.

848
01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:38.500
I was going to give it
to you tomorrow...

849
01:00:38.536 --> 01:00:41.130
but, you know, things
might get a little nuts.

850
01:00:41.172 --> 01:00:42.332
I might forget.

851
01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:45.706
You fight Daimyo in the morning?

852
01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:49.577
OK, so tomorrow afternoon...

853
01:00:49.614 --> 01:00:51.639
I'll teach you some tricks
on your yo-yo.

854
01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:52.876
OK, buddy?

855
01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:55.442
Tomorrow you might die.

856
01:00:57.355 --> 01:00:59.918
Yeah. OK, Yoshi,
you listen to me.

857
01:01:00.011 --> 01:01:02.172
Tomorrow morning,
you and your buddies...

858
01:01:02.213 --> 01:01:05.478
go up into the mountains
and you play, you hear me?

859
01:01:05.517 --> 01:01:08.042
No matter what happens.

860
01:01:11.322 --> 01:01:14.519
I cannot let you die,
Raphael-san.

861
01:01:15.727 --> 01:01:19.993
Don't worry, kid.
Nobody's going to die.

862
01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.565
Hey, Yoshi, come on.
Where you going?

863
01:01:22.602 --> 01:01:25.070
It's late already.
Get yourself to bed.

864
01:01:28.107 --> 01:01:29.631
What are you doing?

865
01:01:31.544 --> 01:01:35.413
Yoshi, this isn't playtime.
Your sister's going to kill me.

866
01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:36.720
What do you got?

867
01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.853
For you, Raphael-san.

868
01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:41.558
You didn't have to.

869
01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:43.566
I find in the woods.

870
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.932
Now you and the other
kappa can go home.

871
01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:47.869
Now you no die.

872
01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.533
Son of a snapper!

873
01:01:53.619 --> 01:01:57.487
I found it!

874
01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.261
Look at this.
It was here the whole time.

875
01:02:00.328 --> 01:02:01.659
It was under the house.

876
01:02:01.696 --> 01:02:03.596
Our little brother put it there.

877
01:02:03.631 --> 01:02:05.656
Mondo surprise!

878
01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:08.238
- We're set.
- Let me see that.

879
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:09.661
Careful, now!
Easy, guys.

880
01:02:09.698 --> 01:02:11.666
- Is it the one?
- That's the one.

881
01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.667
Look, it's the scepter.

882
01:02:12.701 --> 01:02:14.328
Oh, God.
I can't believe it.

883
01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:18.807
So you see, as long as we
didn't have the scepter...

884
01:02:18.841 --> 01:02:21.708
we had no choice
but to stay and fight.

885
01:02:21.744 --> 01:02:23.211
Right?

886
01:02:23.245 --> 01:02:25.577
You mean, we were set up?

887
01:02:27.405 --> 01:02:29.765
- Uncool.
- Very uncool.

888
01:02:29.874 --> 01:02:31.341
Mitsu.

889
01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:33.401
Is that for real?

890
01:02:38.716 --> 01:02:41.514
The vibes in here
just turned bad.

891
01:02:41.552 --> 01:02:42.917
Let's split.

892
01:02:42.954 --> 01:02:46.014
Wait! I am the one.

893
01:02:46.057 --> 01:02:48.719
Please. I am the one...

894
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.728
who told my grandson
to hide the scepter.

895
01:02:50.762 --> 01:02:52.059
What?

896
01:02:52.096 --> 01:02:56.760
I want you to fight, not Mitsu.

897
01:03:00.013 --> 01:03:01.480
- Come on, guys!
- Let's go! Move it!

898
01:03:10.089 --> 01:03:11.420
Evening.

899
01:03:12.859 --> 01:03:14.326
Let me at him!

900
01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.828
Mikey, stay back.
Calm down, man.

901
01:03:17.354 --> 01:03:21.256
Give me the scepter,
my little green friends.

902
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:22.690
No! Kill him!

903
01:03:28.131 --> 01:03:30.031
Raph, give me the scepter.

904
01:03:32.802 --> 01:03:34.133
Man!

905
01:03:37.116 --> 01:03:39.482
Bring Kenshin
to the castle tonight.

906
01:03:39.518 --> 01:03:42.078
You'll get her back.

907
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:44.555
Come morning,
I was you, I'd be gone.

908
01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:52.687
He's riding off.
Guys, we got to do something.

909
01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:58.062
I apologize for this crude
interruption, Daimyo...

910
01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:01.798
but perhaps this little bird
will sing for your supper.

911
01:04:05.278 --> 01:04:07.678
Why have you stolen my son?

912
01:04:08.848 --> 01:04:11.339
I do not have your son.

913
01:04:11.384 --> 01:04:14.649
He's gone on a magic journey.

914
01:04:14.687 --> 01:04:17.554
Only the scepter
can bring him back.

915
01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:22.027
You are lying.
You have them both.

916
01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:25.785
I have nothing.

917
01:04:26.449 --> 01:04:28.542
He has the scepter.

918
01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:43.475
Not as chirpy as I'd hoped.
Niles.

919
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.744
Come on.
Come on!

920
01:04:44.785 --> 01:04:46.184
Get out!
Out!

921
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.312
Take her away!

922
01:04:47.354 --> 01:04:49.618
Come on! Move it!

923
01:04:51.678 --> 01:04:54.738
How did you capture
such a woman?

924
01:04:54.781 --> 01:04:57.073
The same way you capture
any wild animal.

925
01:04:57.153 --> 01:04:59.747
By setting a trap.

926
01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:05.659
I don't have it.

927
01:05:25.396 --> 01:05:27.264
Equal partners.

928
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.241
Right? I'm not
your spy anymore.

929
01:05:35.877 --> 01:05:38.004
I want to see the Daimyo.

930
01:05:39.074 --> 01:05:40.437
Easy with the hands.

931
01:05:40.465 --> 01:05:43.059
Another little birdie
come home to roost.

932
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:49.362
Well, April's inside.
Now it's up to us.

933
01:05:49.407 --> 01:05:52.706
Is this what they mean
by getting totally vertical?

934
01:05:52.975 --> 01:05:55.842
Turtles... it's not just a job.
It's an adventure.

935
01:06:32.194 --> 01:06:33.422
Meow, dude!

936
01:06:34.794 --> 01:06:36.261
His chin's landed on my foot.

937
01:06:36.296 --> 01:06:38.355
Sayonara, blubber butt.

938
01:06:39.632 --> 01:06:40.656
Mitsu!

939
01:06:42.869 --> 01:06:44.336
How's it hanging, babe?

940
01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:45.394
Michaelangelo.

941
01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:48.820
Sorry about the crack
about the bad vibes.

942
01:06:48.854 --> 01:06:51.414
You got great vibes.

943
01:06:51.457 --> 01:06:53.857
Quickly.
We must free the others.

944
01:06:58.629 --> 01:06:59.618
Hey, Whit!

945
01:06:59.663 --> 01:07:02.223
Well, well, well.
Miss O'Neil.

946
01:07:02.266 --> 01:07:04.867
My partner Mr. Whit and I were
just discussing your future.

947
01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:07.202
Let me tell you something
about your partner here.

948
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:08.435
He's scum.

949
01:07:08.475 --> 01:07:10.641
He's the lowest scum
of the earth.

950
01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:13.627
No, you know something?
He's lower than scum.

951
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:15.822
He gives scum a bad name.

952
01:07:15.863 --> 01:07:18.798
Of course he does.
That's why I hired him.

953
01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:20.425
Take her away.

954
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:22.730
Now, wait a minute.

955
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:25.637
I have information
about the Daimyo's son.

956
01:07:25.673 --> 01:07:27.868
I think she's
telling the truth.

957
01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:30.736
Really? Well, I don't
pay you to think, do I?

958
01:07:30.823 --> 01:07:33.451
I pay you to lie,
cheat, and steal.

959
01:07:33.492 --> 01:07:36.393
So why don't you go
down to the harbor...

960
01:07:36.429 --> 01:07:38.556
and bring back the men
and their guns?

961
01:07:38.598 --> 01:07:40.725
Guns?

962
01:07:41.067 --> 01:07:42.796
Maybe she's up here.

963
01:07:42.835 --> 01:07:44.097
Nice and light now.

964
01:07:44.136 --> 01:07:45.933
Love the artwork.

965
01:07:45.972 --> 01:07:48.372
Reservations for five?

966
01:07:48.407 --> 01:07:50.466
Under "T" maybe?

967
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:53.201
Come on! Let's go!

968
01:07:53.244 --> 01:07:54.302
- Move it!
- That's OK, fellas.

969
01:07:54.746 --> 01:07:56.043
We'll find a table ourselves.

970
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:57.514
Little log there.

971
01:07:58.395 --> 01:08:00.420
Everything looks cool up here.

972
01:08:00.463 --> 01:08:02.226
Come on.

973
01:08:02.593 --> 01:08:03.992
Clear on the right.

974
01:08:04.027 --> 01:08:05.494
Clear on the left.

975
01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:12.897
Hey, you guys.
Check it out.

976
01:08:14.938 --> 01:08:18.005
- Ancient us.
- Trippy.

977
01:08:18.213 --> 01:08:20.477
"The battle of the
thousand swords."

978
01:08:20.592 --> 01:08:23.527
Four demons defeated
the Daimyo and his army.

979
01:08:25.099 --> 01:08:26.327
Definitely family.

980
01:08:26.367 --> 01:08:30.394
Looks like me, but it's
got Raph's beak.

981
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:33.426
But it was only a legend.

982
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:36.303
- Dudes, we're legends!
- Hey, cool!

983
01:08:36.339 --> 01:08:37.806
I like it.

984
01:08:37.841 --> 01:08:38.830
Wayne Newton.

985
01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:43.079
You.

986
01:08:43.184 --> 01:08:46.620
You were expecting maybe
the Addams family?

987
01:08:47.655 --> 01:08:49.145
Good one.

988
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:50.517
You have come back.

989
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:51.915
Yeah, we like to drop in...

990
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:53.509
about every three
or four centuries.

991
01:08:53.553 --> 01:08:55.885
Yeah, and it looks like
you're having a rough day...

992
01:08:55.922 --> 01:09:01.360
so give us the scepter back
and we'll get out of here.

993
01:09:03.563 --> 01:09:08.523
You have disgraced my ancestor,
but you will not disgrace me.

994
01:09:08.568 --> 01:09:09.660
I'm willing to die.

995
01:09:09.702 --> 01:09:11.226
Kill them.

996
01:09:12.406 --> 01:09:17.207
We will both die, but only
one of us with honor.

997
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:26.330
Are we out of the loop here
or what?

998
01:09:31.304 --> 01:09:32.396
Chill, dude!

999
01:09:34.607 --> 01:09:35.365
You OK?

1000
01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:36.798
Mikey, watch out!

1001
01:09:37.902 --> 01:09:41.838
Oh, he who dings
the shell must pay!

1002
01:10:03.143 --> 01:10:04.371
Your turn!

1003
01:10:06.313 --> 01:10:08.907
One, two, three, and kick!

1004
01:10:09.728 --> 01:10:10.717
Good night!

1005
01:10:12.864 --> 01:10:15.025
Bases loaded.
Home run!

1006
01:10:16.267 --> 01:10:17.495
Leapfrog!

1007
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.301
Triple play!

1008
01:10:31.735 --> 01:10:33.202
Hello.

1009
01:10:33.236 --> 01:10:34.225
Good-bye.

1010
01:10:40.377 --> 01:10:42.309
- All right, good job, turtles.
- Yes!

1011
01:10:42.311 --> 01:10:43.778
Leo, high foot!

1012
01:10:43.812 --> 01:10:46.781
All right. Let's
rock 'n' roll, dudes.

1013
01:10:46.815 --> 01:10:48.339
More logs.

1014
01:10:49.758 --> 01:10:51.919
Hey, mac!

1015
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.228
Take the rest of the day off.

1016
01:10:53.233 --> 01:10:54.700
I'll open the dungeon.

1017
01:10:55.721 --> 01:10:57.154
- You guys go that way.
- We must open the gate.

1018
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:58.817
No problemo.

1019
01:10:58.852 --> 01:11:00.149
Scuds!

1020
01:11:05.692 --> 01:11:07.819
One, two, three, four.

1021
01:11:07.861 --> 01:11:10.455
You're free, guys.
Let's go!

1022
01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:36.287
I love this stuff!

1023
01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.828
I get such a kick
out of this job!

1024
01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:01.149
Hold it, bucko!

1025
01:12:26.552 --> 01:12:28.417
Big mistake, dude.

1026
01:12:43.335 --> 01:12:45.803
Go ahead.
Finish me.

1027
01:12:53.006 --> 01:12:55.702
There. Short enough for you?

1028
01:12:56.663 --> 01:12:57.960
Kappa.

1029
01:13:14.154 --> 01:13:15.121
Hello?

1030
01:13:15.155 --> 01:13:16.645
Who's trapped inside?

1031
01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:18.351
Lord Norinaga.

1032
01:13:24.698 --> 01:13:26.359
Name rings a bell.

1033
01:13:28.973 --> 01:13:30.804
Turtles one.
Daimyo zip.

1034
01:13:30.842 --> 01:13:32.400
Look!

1035
01:13:33.845 --> 01:13:35.142
It's April.

1036
01:13:36.801 --> 01:13:39.167
Well, if it ain't
the phantom of the opera.

1037
01:13:39.203 --> 01:13:42.430
Love to stay and chat, but...

1038
01:13:42.572 --> 01:13:45.370
places to go... people to kill.

1039
01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:52.891
Come on, lads!

1040
01:13:52.933 --> 01:13:54.901
Move it. Move it!

1041
01:13:54.935 --> 01:13:55.902
Out of the way!

1042
01:13:55.936 --> 01:13:57.665
Oh, no. Guns!

1043
01:13:57.705 --> 01:13:59.070
There goes the neighborhood.

1044
01:13:59.106 --> 01:14:00.767
Wait!

1045
01:14:00.808 --> 01:14:02.173
Thank you, Mr. Whit.

1046
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:03.403
Yeah, Whit.

1047
01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:04.706
You make a great servant.

1048
01:14:04.745 --> 01:14:05.778
I'm real impressed.

1049
01:14:05.895 --> 01:14:09.353
My God!
Who's your tailor?

1050
01:14:09.399 --> 01:14:10.388
We're naked.

1051
01:14:11.434 --> 01:14:12.833
You OK, April?

1052
01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:14.769
Sorry, guys.

1053
01:14:14.804 --> 01:14:15.862
We really don't have time...

1054
01:14:15.905 --> 01:14:17.065
for any of these
social pleasantries...

1055
01:14:17.106 --> 01:14:18.198
I'm afraid.

1056
01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:19.367
Shoot them.

1057
01:14:19.409 --> 01:14:20.740
Right.

1058
01:14:22.011 --> 01:14:25.105
Don't move a finger!

1059
01:14:27.478 --> 01:14:28.877
What did you say?

1060
01:14:28.913 --> 01:14:31.347
I said, shoot them.

1061
01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:34.914
That wasn't part of
the deal, Walker.

1062
01:14:35.753 --> 01:14:36.747
Well, if you feel like that...

1063
01:14:36.754 --> 01:14:39.016
you'd better join them,
hadn't you?

1064
01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.402
- Niles!
- Right.

1065
01:14:42.443 --> 01:14:44.070
Hey, come on.

1066
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:45.908
Shoot him, too.

1067
01:14:45.946 --> 01:14:47.345
With pleasure!

1068
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:48.905
Weasel!

1069
01:14:48.949 --> 01:14:50.473
Ready...

1070
01:14:51.706 --> 01:14:54.266
Gee, if we die here
in the past...

1071
01:14:54.308 --> 01:14:57.471
does that mean that we don't
get born in the future?

1072
01:14:57.511 --> 01:15:01.538
Hey, Tinkerbell,
why don't you shoot us?

1073
01:15:01.582 --> 01:15:02.674
Leo, wait...

1074
01:15:03.557 --> 01:15:05.391
I'm sorry.
Are you addressing me?

1075
01:15:05.474 --> 01:15:09.774
Shoot us yourself,
unless you're too scared.

1076
01:15:09.811 --> 01:15:11.745
I get it!

1077
01:15:13.323 --> 01:15:15.621
He knows he can't kill us.

1078
01:15:15.659 --> 01:15:17.524
We're demons.

1079
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:19.290
We are demons!

1080
01:15:19.329 --> 01:15:21.289
Your bullets will
just bounce back...

1081
01:15:21.387 --> 01:15:23.548
and kill all you guys instead.

1082
01:15:23.589 --> 01:15:24.988
Right. What he said.

1083
01:15:25.024 --> 01:15:26.048
Capisce?

1084
01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:30.166
Would you like the pleasure
of the first shot, Captain?

1085
01:15:30.209 --> 01:15:33.906
Go ahead, punk.
Make my day.

1086
01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.779
If it's going to make you all
feel better...

1087
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.482
I've got a good idea.

1088
01:15:43.553 --> 01:15:44.679
Where's he going?

1089
01:15:44.721 --> 01:15:46.848
Out. Out of the way.

1090
01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:49.781
What's he doing?

1091
01:15:49.826 --> 01:15:51.953
This doesn't bode well.

1092
01:15:53.329 --> 01:15:55.524
Nice bluff, Mr. Leader.

1093
01:15:55.565 --> 01:15:57.132
- Major bummer.
- We're toast.

1094
01:15:59.177 --> 01:16:01.042
Try this on for size.

1095
01:16:02.647 --> 01:16:04.547
This could hurt.

1096
01:16:11.055 --> 01:16:15.151
Hoo, boy, do I love
being a turtle!

1097
01:16:15.319 --> 01:16:16.946
Yes. That's very clever.

1098
01:16:16.987 --> 01:16:18.784
Oh, yes. Very clever.

1099
01:16:18.822 --> 01:16:21.290
Missed me!

1100
01:16:25.442 --> 01:16:27.034
Guess what time it is?

1101
01:16:27.077 --> 01:16:29.705
Willy, willy, willy!
Willy, willy!

1102
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:32.839
Take a hike, pal.

1103
01:16:32.882 --> 01:16:34.213
Let's get Walker!

1104
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:35.717
Hey, guys!

1105
01:16:41.391 --> 01:16:44.485
Oh, look. Don King.

1106
01:16:49.152 --> 01:16:51.382
Smells like a geek
ran through here.

1107
01:16:56.666 --> 01:16:57.860
My little guys.
I almost forgot you.

1108
01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.094
Come on.

1109
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.264
Where'd he go?

1110
01:17:05.298 --> 01:17:06.390
There he goes.
Out the window.

1111
01:17:06.433 --> 01:17:07.661
Over there!
Let's go!

1112
01:17:07.701 --> 01:17:08.668
Come on, Mikey.

1113
01:17:08.702 --> 01:17:09.669
We'll go out front
and cut him off.

1114
01:17:09.703 --> 01:17:11.068
Come on, guys!

1115
01:17:13.907 --> 01:17:15.738
Hurry, Raph.

1116
01:17:15.775 --> 01:17:17.470
Right behind you, Leo.

1117
01:17:20.164 --> 01:17:22.255
- He's up there, Donny. Come on.
- All right. Let's go.

1118
01:17:23.179 --> 01:17:24.806
This is so good for your calves.

1119
01:17:35.832 --> 01:17:37.265
Stop right there!

1120
01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.291
Or you're a goner, dude.

1121
01:17:39.336 --> 01:17:40.894
Totally.

1122
01:17:47.744 --> 01:17:49.837
What kind of demons are you?

1123
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.178
We're turtles, friend.

1124
01:17:52.215 --> 01:17:57.448
Of the teenage mutant
ninja variety, sleazeball!

1125
01:18:10.479 --> 01:18:12.309
Check it out!

1126
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:17.375
This, I believe, is what
you've been searching for.

1127
01:18:18.687 --> 01:18:20.450
Go fetch.

1128
01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:24.800
Wait! There goes
our ride home!

1129
01:18:24.839 --> 01:18:27.034
Do you really think
I'd make it that easy...

1130
01:18:27.075 --> 01:18:30.306
you nasty little reptiles?

1131
01:18:30.345 --> 01:18:31.972
I got it!
I got it!

1132
01:18:32.013 --> 01:18:33.446
I call!

1133
01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:37.817
Oh, not again!

1134
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.412
Mikey, get it!

1135
01:18:40.455 --> 01:18:42.150
Go, Mike, go!

1136
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.299
Nice catch. I got you!

1137
01:18:51.848 --> 01:18:52.940
We got it.

1138
01:19:10.165 --> 01:19:14.864
Bungee jumping without a bungee.
That could be dangerous.

1139
01:19:14.903 --> 01:19:15.961
You got that.

1140
01:19:23.745 --> 01:19:25.212
Hey, guys.

1141
01:19:26.139 --> 01:19:28.573
We have an egg timer to catch.

1142
01:19:28.608 --> 01:19:30.542
Let's move it.

1143
01:19:32.478 --> 01:19:34.576
Buckle up, dudes.
It's time to go home.

1144
01:19:34.637 --> 01:19:36.628
Hey, guys.
I'm not going back.

1145
01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:38.162
- What?
- What did you say?

1146
01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:39.936
I said I'm staying here.

1147
01:19:40.486 --> 01:19:41.977
I'm not going back with you.

1148
01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.252
Michaelangelo, come on.

1149
01:19:43.294 --> 01:19:44.420
You can't be serious.

1150
01:19:45.303 --> 01:19:49.667
- He's serious.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1151
01:19:50.234 --> 01:19:52.301
You are going back to New York.

1152
01:19:52.405 --> 01:19:55.272
Been there, done that.

1153
01:19:55.308 --> 01:19:58.171
Michaelangelo, it's our home.

1154
01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.462
Sure. Your home's
a nice apartment.

1155
01:20:00.515 --> 01:20:02.506
My home's a sewer.

1156
01:20:02.551 --> 01:20:04.849
I been thinking
the same thing, Leo.

1157
01:20:04.887 --> 01:20:06.517
People appreciate us here.

1158
01:20:06.595 --> 01:20:07.994
We don't have to
live like moles.

1159
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:10.089
Hey, whoa.
No way!

1160
01:20:10.132 --> 01:20:13.124
We're all going back.
Tell him, Leo.

1161
01:20:13.169 --> 01:20:14.261
Actually...

1162
01:20:14.303 --> 01:20:16.635
Hey, not to sound
selfish or anything...

1163
01:20:16.672 --> 01:20:18.299
but what the heck.
Why not?

1164
01:20:18.341 --> 01:20:20.767
I do not want to stay here.

1165
01:20:20.965 --> 01:20:21.932
Me, neither.

1166
01:20:21.966 --> 01:20:24.127
Do you think I could
possibly live...

1167
01:20:24.168 --> 01:20:26.329
without a single microchip?

1168
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:30.467
Somebody's activated
the scepter.

1169
01:20:30.508 --> 01:20:32.100
We got to go now!

1170
01:20:33.689 --> 01:20:35.680
Kenshin, no!

1171
01:20:35.725 --> 01:20:39.661
We wait four hundred years,
and this Casey is still late.

1172
01:20:39.695 --> 01:20:41.063
I will wait no longer.

1173
01:20:41.159 --> 01:20:44.617
Kenshin, you cannot go
without the others.

1174
01:20:44.663 --> 01:20:46.893
It would be cowardly.

1175
01:20:53.965 --> 01:20:56.191
Come on. Both of you.

1176
01:20:56.259 --> 01:20:58.727
Yeah. Come on.
Got to get back.

1177
01:20:58.762 --> 01:21:00.730
Time to go.

1178
01:21:02.631 --> 01:21:05.823
Come on, you party animals.
I know. Yeah.

1179
01:21:05.993 --> 01:21:07.761
OK. Come on.
Get it together.

1180
01:21:07.788 --> 01:21:08.855
I just wanted
to give you guys...

1181
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:11.242
a nice peek at the future,
all right?

1182
01:21:11.714 --> 01:21:14.547
Bet you guys feel lucky
to be going back, right?

1183
01:21:14.584 --> 01:21:17.348
Very lucky.
We're going back.

1184
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:19.724
Not!

1185
01:21:23.707 --> 01:21:25.805
This could really
screw up history.

1186
01:21:26.003 --> 01:21:27.937
All right. OK.
Enough is enough.

1187
01:21:27.972 --> 01:21:30.304
OK? Let's go.
Come on.

1188
01:21:31.375 --> 01:21:34.469
Guys, you cannot split up.

1189
01:21:34.511 --> 01:21:36.706
You're brothers.
Remember?

1190
01:21:36.747 --> 01:21:38.612
Yeah. I guess.

1191
01:21:38.649 --> 01:21:40.078
Raphael-san.

1192
01:21:40.092 --> 01:21:41.389
Hey, Yoshi.

1193
01:21:41.427 --> 01:21:43.156
Yoshi wants to say good-bye.

1194
01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:45.595
But we're not going back.

1195
01:21:45.631 --> 01:21:47.997
Me and Raph are
going to be staying.

1196
01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:50.093
No!

1197
01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:53.021
Kenshin must return.

1198
01:21:53.066 --> 01:21:54.431
You promised.

1199
01:21:54.467 --> 01:21:55.798
Yeah, but...

1200
01:21:55.835 --> 01:21:59.897
Our two families must be united,
or the wars will start again.

1201
01:21:59.962 --> 01:22:01.293
But I thought...

1202
01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:05.596
I want to stay here with you.

1203
01:22:05.634 --> 01:22:08.569
You will always
be here with me...

1204
01:22:08.604 --> 01:22:10.128
Michaelangelo.

1205
01:22:14.676 --> 01:22:16.644
Uh-oh, guys.
It's picking up speed.

1206
01:22:16.678 --> 01:22:17.940
Come on!

1207
01:22:21.143 --> 01:22:22.906
There was traffic, man.

1208
01:22:24.633 --> 01:22:28.091
Benkei, no! Wait. No!

1209
01:22:28.137 --> 01:22:30.601
I been thinking.
We have to go back.

1210
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:32.153
It's our destiny.

1211
01:22:32.999 --> 01:22:34.990
I mean, if we stay here...

1212
01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:38.060
we interfere with their lives,
and that would be selfish.

1213
01:22:38.104 --> 01:22:39.435
Exactly.

1214
01:22:39.472 --> 01:22:41.372
Our lives are in New York.

1215
01:22:41.407 --> 01:22:42.465
Right, guys?

1216
01:22:44.723 --> 01:22:46.315
It's "Star Trek" time, guys.

1217
01:22:46.358 --> 01:22:47.723
Hey, Yoshi man.

1218
01:22:47.759 --> 01:22:49.192
Raphael-san.

1219
01:22:49.228 --> 01:22:50.718
Yo, Yoshi.

1220
01:22:52.764 --> 01:22:55.756
I will never forget you,
Raphael-san.

1221
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:58.229
I won't forget you, either,
little man.

1222
01:22:58.232 --> 01:22:59.995
And remember, watch that temper.

1223
01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:04.135
Hey, all right!

1224
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:05.570
No, no, no.

1225
01:23:05.606 --> 01:23:08.134
I'll put this on layaway
for you, OK?

1226
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:10.115
All right?
Give you an excuse...

1227
01:23:10.192 --> 01:23:13.161
to come back, Zen Meister, OK?

1228
01:23:15.598 --> 01:23:16.626
All right.

1229
01:23:16.673 --> 01:23:17.970
Benkei!

1230
01:23:19.275 --> 01:23:21.038
You got a bus to catch.

1231
01:23:21.077 --> 01:23:24.069
Come on. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Good.

1232
01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:28.117
It's OK, man.
Go ahead.

1233
01:23:28.151 --> 01:23:28.948
It'll be all right.

1234
01:23:28.993 --> 01:23:30.187
Benkei!

1235
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:34.256
See you later.

1236
01:23:34.298 --> 01:23:35.856
Later.

1237
01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.527
Come on, Mikey!

1238
01:23:37.568 --> 01:23:39.796
If you ever get to New York...

1239
01:23:39.886 --> 01:23:41.012
Yeah, later, Mikey!

1240
01:23:41.054 --> 01:23:45.718
OK. Destiny... what a drag! Bye.

1241
01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:47.984
Mikey! Hurry!

1242
01:23:48.028 --> 01:23:48.855
I'm coming!

1243
01:23:48.928 --> 01:23:51.192
Come on, Mikey!
Come on!

1244
01:23:53.099 --> 01:23:56.296
Mikey!

1245
01:24:03.743 --> 01:24:06.712
Guys, we made it back
to the den.

1246
01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.378
Michaelangelo?

1247
01:24:14.415 --> 01:24:15.848
Mikey?

1248
01:24:23.473 --> 01:24:25.566
- Get that guy!
- He's got the scepter!

1249
01:24:25.609 --> 01:24:28.476
- No!
- Get him!

1250
01:24:28.512 --> 01:24:30.139
Grab him!

1251
01:24:50.033 --> 01:24:51.523
Oh, boy.

1252
01:24:51.568 --> 01:24:52.893
You made it back!

1253
01:24:52.909 --> 01:24:55.109
We thought we lost you
forever, Mikey.

1254
01:24:55.139 --> 01:24:56.207
Thought you were a goner!

1255
01:24:56.293 --> 01:24:58.784
- I'm glad you're OK.
- Hi, guys.

1256
01:24:58.829 --> 01:25:00.160
Michaelangelo.

1257
01:25:17.815 --> 01:25:19.407
Father.

1258
01:25:21.185 --> 01:25:22.311
Kenshin.

1259
01:25:49.664 --> 01:25:51.131
Hockey.

1260
01:25:51.165 --> 01:25:53.065
Hockey.

1261
01:26:06.968 --> 01:26:08.265
Kenshin!

1262
01:26:15.366 --> 01:26:16.731
Michaelangelo?

1263
01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:19.588
Yes, Master Splinter?

1264
01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:23.122
Something deeply
troubles you, my son.

1265
01:26:23.243 --> 01:26:24.875
Growing up.

1266
01:26:25.043 --> 01:26:27.876
I don't think
I'll ever laugh again.

1267
01:26:30.757 --> 01:26:31.883
Yo, dude!

1268
01:26:36.123 --> 01:26:38.250
Yo, dude!

1269
01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:40.760
Just like Elvis
in "Blue Hawaii."

1270
01:26:44.097 --> 01:26:45.758
I saw it on cable.

1271
01:26:47.801 --> 01:26:48.790
Oh, boy.

1272
01:26:48.835 --> 01:26:49.824
Hey, Mikey!

1273
01:26:57.377 --> 01:26:58.435
Gone.

1274
01:27:01.377 --> 01:27:04.435
