<i> Life's pretty</i>
<i> simple, you know.</i>

3
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.121
<i> It's long periods of waiting</i>

4
00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:25.024
<i> broken up by brief</i>
<i> moments of change.</i>

5
00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:27.659
<i> That's it. That's all it is.</i>

6
00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.764
<i> You see, here's my theory.</i>

7
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.499
<i> The moments of change?</i>

8
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.468
<i> They're what give</i>
<i> your life its shape,</i>

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.604
<i> its form.</i>

10
00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.773
<i> But it only takes one</i>
<i> of them to define you</i>

11
00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.842
<i> and that'll be the only</i>
<i> thing you're remembered for,</i>

12
00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.210
<i> and you know it.</i>

13
00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.446
<i> In the instant</i>
<i> it happens,</i>
<i> you sense it,</i>

14
00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:50.149
<i> and the world</i>
<i> is changed forever.</i>

15
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:53.085
<i> You are forever changed.</i>

16
00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.636
All right kids.
See you later,
all right?

17
00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.505
I love you.
I love you
too, daddy.

18
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:47.873
Kiss. See
you later.

19
00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.708
Love you, all right.
Bye, daddy.

20
00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.612
All right?
See you later.

21
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:54.880
Bye.

22
00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.289
All right mate,
look, I'm loading!

23
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.790
Look, I'm loading.

24
00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.208
Morning! Big fan,
Mr. Harris!

25
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.491
<i> I don't</i>
<i> believe in no fate.</i>

26
00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:15.160
No Karma,
no coincidences,

27
00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:18.463
no conspiracy theories or
any of that other bullshit.

28
00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:21.733
Shit just happens.
And life?

29
00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:24.836
That's just the
shit that happens

30
00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:28.073
while you're wishing you were
someone or somewhere else.

31
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.683
Who were you chatting to?

32
00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.818
No one, I was
just on the phone.

33
00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.654
What are you
doing out there?

34
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.891
You ain't smoking
again, are you?

35
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.727
No, come on, mom. You
know I'm off that now.

36
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.295
It just gets a bit
stuffy in my room.

37
00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.930
Getting a bit
of fresh air.

38
00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.576
Ain't you forgetting
something?

39
00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.079
Head's up me ass today.

40
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:09.081
Here, I've even given
them a clean and all.

41
00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.416
Thanks, darling,
i don't know what
I'd do without you.

42
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.684
Don't know why you wear
your boots anyway.

43
00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:14.686
You only shout and
moan on the sides.

44
00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:17.222
What? I'm teaching them
the beautiful game.

45
00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:19.291
Anyway, I need my boots today
so I can run up and down

46
00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:20.592
handing out your
sponsorship forms

47
00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:21.994
to them dads who are
going to give you

48
00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:23.795
loads of money
for your charity.

49
00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:26.465
Look, never mind them.

50
00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:29.067
Just check if ravi's
heard any news.

51
00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.869
Yeah, I will. I will.

52
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.771
Leave it with me.

53
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.006
Bye, darling.

54
00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:50.188
Morning, gents!
How are we all?

55
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.890
You all right?
How you doing, hal?

56
00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:53.725
Pretty good, mate. You?
Good. Good to see ya.

57
00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:54.660
How are ya?

58
00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:55.961
Right, I've got
a very, very

59
00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.596
important announcement
from the missus.

60
00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.399
She's doing a fun run
for, uh, disabled kids.

61
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:01.933
The fun part is going
to be watching her

62
00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:04.236
and her lumpy parts run around
battersea for an hour.

63
00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:05.804
But...

64
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.472
Could you, uh, do
what you can for her?

65
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.308
Okay.
Yeah? Thanks very
much, guys.

66
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.742
Cheers. Cheers.

67
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.281
All right, ravi?
Any news, mate?

68
00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:19.951
Don't worry. All the
references are sorted.
Right.

69
00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:22.621
Exciting times, huh?

70
00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:24.656
That's fantastic.
Thank you, mate.

71
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.425
Thank you so much.
Not a problem, mate.

72
00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:28.026
Yeah, she's going
to be well chuffed.

73
00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.762
It means a lot to us.
Thank you, rav.

74
00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:33.532
Right, lads!
Over here, please!

75
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.037
Are you okay?

76
00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.573
Yeah. Why?

77
00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.209
You just seem a
little bit distracted.

78
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:45.777
I'm okay.

79
00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:50.115
I just wish I didn't
have to sneak around,

80
00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:52.617
be so secretive.

81
00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:54.486
He's the one that was
screwing the nanny.

82
00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.458
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

83
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.827
It's all right.
I just...

84
00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:04.363
I don't really need
you to remind me.

85
00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.104
Sorry, excuse me.
I'm just gonna...

86
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.340
I'm just gonna...

87
00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:20.846
So...

88
00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:25.550
I found this
the other day.

89
00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.688
Oh, my god.

90
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.956
Do you
remember that night?

91
00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.425
That's the first
night I met you.

92
00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:34.726
Yes, it was.
It was.

93
00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.028
And you haven't
changed a bit.

94
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.563
Yeah, right.

95
00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:42.768
Shame it's 10 years
and two kids later.

96
00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:46.338
Well, have you thought
about getting back into it?

97
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.540
Acting?
Mmm-hmm.

98
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.942
No.
Why not?

99
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:52.978
I wouldn't know
how to go about it.

100
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.881
There's got to be someone
that you can call,

101
00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:57.649
point you in the
right direction.

102
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:02.020
I can take some new
headshots for you,

103
00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:06.658
get a couple of,
like, really moody,
10x8s,

104
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.428
really actory ones.

105
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.392
Hey. Kids
get off okay?
Yes, all good.

106
00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:41.960
Evie took ages
to get off, though.

107
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:44.529
Oh, I'll go and
check on her.
Listen, Emily...

108
00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.032
Uh, you're supposed
to call first.

109
00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:51.536
I did, but you were
obviously busy, so...

110
00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:53.271
What do you want?

111
00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:55.974
Well, a signed
shirt from the loft
and kiss our children,

112
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.742
is that all right?

113
00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.244
Off you go then.
Your audience awaits.

114
00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.717
Don't you fancy it?
No.

115
00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:08.820
Goodbye, Max.

116
00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.678
<i> Good evening again,</i>
<i> ladies and gents.</i>

117
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.213
<i> A bit of quiet please,</i>

118
00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:38.683
<i> because it's time to meet</i>
<i> the man of the moment.</i>

119
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.819
<i> Please welcome to</i>
<i> the stage our host,</i>

120
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:44.155
<i> former england rugby</i>
<i> captain, a true hero,</i>

121
00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:48.693
<i> and our very own gladiator,</i>
<i> Maximus Moore.</i>

122
00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.904
Thank you, Dan.

123
00:08:58.906 --> 00:08:59.971
<i> Thank you,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen.</i>

124
00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:02.107
<i> As my grandmother</i>
<i> once said,</i>

125
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:06.044
<i> "it's always good to have</i>
<i> a warm hand on your opening."</i>

126
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:09.848
<i> Um, in</i>
<i> all seriousness,</i>

127
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.850
<i> thank you so much for</i>
<i> supporting our foundation.</i>

128
00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:15.287
<i> You know, our aim is to</i>
<i> raise even more money</i>

129
00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:19.124
<i> and encourage those less</i>
<i> fortunate than ourselves</i>
<i> to play rugby</i>

130
00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:21.760
<i> and perhaps learn</i>
<i> the disciplines of</i>
<i> working on a team.</i>

131
00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:24.863
<i> So, uh, sit back</i>
<i> and we'll run the vt</i>

132
00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:27.599
<i> of some of our fantastic work</i>
<i> that we've been doing. Cheers.</i>

133
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.747
Say cheese.
Cheese!

134
00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.750
Nice one.
Thanks, girls.

135
00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:46.818
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.

136
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.587
See ya.
Later.

137
00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.655
Bye, Max.
See ya.
Yeah.

138
00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.025
Are you sure?

139
00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:56.428
Mate, I ain't getting
any at home, am I?

140
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.331
You think she's still seeing
that photographer bloke?

141
00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:00.799
Cunt.

142
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.500
So, what're you gonna do?

143
00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.835
Well, I'll see
how she likes it

144
00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:05.403
when her credit card
gets stopped, yeah?

145
00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.505
Seriously?
Yeah, mate.

146
00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:11.209
Listen, call your mate and
get him to grab some gear.

147
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:12.577
Oh, yeah.

148
00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.646
And I'll sort
those two out.

149
00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:17.782
Sorry, I don't
think that picture
came out really well.

150
00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.733
It's dead in here, b.
Fam, this action's shit!

151
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.569
Hey, yo,
let's go hit vip.

152
00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:41.740
What? Do you think
we can get in?

153
00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:43.875
Watch. Let me deal
with this, you know?

154
00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.443
Yeah.
Come.

155
00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:47.278
Say no more.

156
00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.048
Walk on.

157
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.117
You got a stamp?

158
00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:54.686
Hey, look, yeah?

159
00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:58.223
I don't think so.

160
00:10:58.225 --> 00:10:59.924
This ain't for your
type, little man.

161
00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:03.561
Wh... we've been invited,
mate. We're on a table.

162
00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:05.697
Trust me.
I don't think so.

163
00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.533
And you stink of weed.

164
00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:10.468
So, you need to
leave the club now.

165
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.904
Hey, come on, brother.
Where's your empathy?

166
00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:16.608
I don't know you,
and you ain't my brother.

167
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.744
So step aside...
Yeah, we don't wanna
fucking know you!

168
00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.947
Mandingo fucking prick!

169
00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.753
Fucking dickhead!
Fuck you, man!

170
00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:30.121
Idiots!

171
00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:36.061
Fucking wanker!

172
00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:37.128
Shit!

173
00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:38.863
Come here!

174
00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.165
Get the fuck off me, man!

175
00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.468
Get the fuck off
him!

176
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.871
Hey! Leave him!
Leave him the fuck alone!

177
00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.606
Get the fuck off me.

178
00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:50.575
Get the fuck off me.

179
00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:52.343
Get off me!

180
00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:03.922
Get off me!

181
00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:32.043
Look what the
cat's dragged in, eh?

182
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:34.045
What've you done
to your face?

183
00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:36.147
Mom, mom, it's nothing.
Just slipped.

184
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.382
Had a couple
of drinks n' that.

185
00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.217
Who was you with?
My boy Sean, innit?

186
00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:41.519
Well, that boy's
got brains.

187
00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:44.022
I bet he didn't get himself
into such a condition.

188
00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:46.858
That's going to look
great in job interviews.

189
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.060
Mom, it's fine.
Trust me.

190
00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.596
Just make sure you get
Amelia to church on time.

191
00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:56.734
What do you say, shorty.
You ready, yeah?

192
00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.102
You smell.

193
00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.040
"Immediate return
to court order..."

194
00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:04.142
Hey! That's none
of your business.

195
00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:08.012
You going back
to prison?
What?

196
00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.781
No. Of course not.

197
00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:11.850
Look, I'll just take a
pregnant white chick to court

198
00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:13.551
and they'll give me
community service.

199
00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:18.389
Hey.

200
00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:22.594
I ain't ever going
back there, you know?

201
00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.529
I promise you.

202
00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.067
Now, come on.

203
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.302
Let's go before we both
get in trouble, yeah?

204
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.280
"Upon such sacrifices,
my cordelia..."

205
00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:47.518
"The gods themselves
throw incense."

206
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.990
Must be, what, um,
four years since we
did<i> lear</i> together?

207
00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:54.926
Eight years ago.
Oh!

208
00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:59.497
That's the price you pay
for those thunderous thighs

209
00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:01.532
and the glamorous
life of a wag.

210
00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:06.638
How is, uh,
Mr. neanderthal?

211
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.139
Being a royal pain.

212
00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:10.441
Yes, that's why
you're here, I suppose?

213
00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:11.776
You miss me.

214
00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:13.845
You've finally
succumbed to my...

215
00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:16.080
My, uh, mature charm.

216
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.349
Mmm, something like that.

217
00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:23.988
It's not easy with
a family, I'm sure,

218
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.326
but we make our choices.

219
00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:31.629
Yeah, but it'll be good
for me to be working again.

220
00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:33.231
For everyone, you know?

221
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.266
Keep me off the happy
pills.

222
00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.569
We're all the
same, you know.

223
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:40.905
Without our passion,

224
00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:45.243
it's very hard for
us to find our place
in the world.

225
00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.245
That aimed at
him or me?

226
00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:51.516
Now, I'm delighted
i can help.

227
00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.385
I always hoped
you'd be back.

228
00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:57.422
Consider it done.

229
00:15:57.424 --> 00:15:59.624
Don't worry about it.
It'll be all right.

230
00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.926
Fingers crossed, eh?

231
00:16:01.928 --> 00:16:04.729
Otherwise it'll be more
than a fucking broomstick
she shoves up me.

232
00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:12.870
I'm really sorry, madam,
but the system's saying,
"card declined."

233
00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:15.006
Leo, give me my
phone. Give me...

234
00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:20.011
Sorry. Thanks.

235
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.151
For fuck's sake, Max,
i couldn't even get a present

236
00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.087
for the kid's
birthday party.

237
00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:30.488
You said you'd
set up the account.

238
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.557
You said you'd
transferred my allowance!

239
00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:35.026
Stop trying to control me!

240
00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.695
Hold my hand, Leo.

241
00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.236
Hi. Come in.

242
00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:46.904
How are you?
Not too bad. Yourself?

243
00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.573
Very well.
Good, good.

244
00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:52.443
I know you've both
done good work

245
00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:54.579
in the preparation
group classes

246
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:56.381
and it's been a
long six months,

247
00:16:56.383 --> 00:16:57.648
but we're nearly
there now.

248
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.384
I don't know why

249
00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:00.785
you don't just
make us wait

250
00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:03.254
the full nine like the
real thing.

251
00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.722
Our assessment's
all but done,

252
00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:07.525
and Dr. ravi buttar's
reference was first-class.

253
00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.594
He really respects
you, George.

254
00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:11.062
Oh!

255
00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:15.066
I should play his son
up-front every week.

256
00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:20.538
One minor issue has reared
its ugly head, though,
I'm afraid, guys.

257
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.075
A couple of arrests
in your teens, George.

258
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:26.177
Football hooliganism?

259
00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:28.713
You assured us
of full disclosure.

260
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.655
That was years ago.
I mean, I was only a kid.

261
00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:41.059
Youthful exuberance,
i think they called it.

262
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.027
Common assault and
disturbing the peace

263
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:45.630
can be seen by some as more
than a misspent youth, George.

264
00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.967
No, I mean, literally,
it was 30 years ago.

265
00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:51.903
West ham ain't won
a trophy since.

266
00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.571
I think what my better
half is trying to say

267
00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.406
is that having played up
a bit in his teens,

268
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.607
he will be
experienced enough

269
00:17:56.609 --> 00:17:58.209
to make sure that
our kid knows

270
00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:00.211
the pitfalls of hanging
out with wrong 'uns.

271
00:18:00.213 --> 00:18:02.113
Yeah, and I've met
plenty of wrong 'uns.

272
00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:08.286
To be honest,
we're both so nervous
today, and, um...

273
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.123
All we want is what
everyone else has

274
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:14.425
and to give all the
love we have to a baby

275
00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.194
who deserves and needs it.

276
00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:21.332
We just want to be
given a chance.

277
00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:24.802
That's all.

278
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.519
Kathy.

279
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:42.687
Kath!

280
00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:54.165
Hi, Jake.

281
00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:56.868
Yeah, yeah.

282
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.937
Actually, um, I thought about
what you said the other day

283
00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:04.475
and, um, guess
who I had lunch
with today?

284
00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.512
Um, my actor friend,
Terence Harris.

285
00:19:07.514 --> 00:19:09.580
No, no, not like that.

286
00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:12.283
- But he did say that...
- Daddy's here!

287
00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:13.684
- My kids are here!
- Daddy! Daddy!

288
00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:16.120
Can I call you back?
Um, I'll tell you later.

289
00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:18.156
In about an
hour? Yeah.

290
00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.324
Da-da-da-da
da-da-da-da-da!

291
00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.193
Mommy, look what
daddy bought us!

292
00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:23.661
Wow, that's great!

293
00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.329
Why don't you
open them outside?

294
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.565
Because mommy needs to
talk to daddy in private.

295
00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.467
Well, that makes a change.

296
00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:31.469
Go on, I'll be in there
in a second, all right?

297
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.271
Okay, okay.

298
00:19:33.273 --> 00:19:35.573
You might be able to
manipulate your groupies

299
00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:38.676
and your so-called mates,
and even your own kids,

300
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:39.810
but not me, Max,

301
00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:41.779
not since you shat
on your own doorstep.

302
00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:43.181
What is going on,
that's why I gave you
your own space...

303
00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.950
Look, I haven't finished!

304
00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:49.220
How dare you
humiliate me like that
in front of my own kids?

305
00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:50.688
Like what? What are
you talking about?

306
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.056
Like what? Is this
about the money?

307
00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:53.257
Of course it's
about the money.

308
00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:54.392
All right, okay,
fine, you know,

309
00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:55.493
I lost my credit
card, okay?

310
00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:56.894
And they put
a block on it.

311
00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:58.829
And I realized that you
might come up short,

312
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:02.500
so I went to the bank
and got you some cash.
Here you go.

313
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.872
That's why
i came round today,

314
00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.808
to make sure you and
the kids were okay.

315
00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:14.946
Um...

316
00:20:14.948 --> 00:20:17.582
Em, come on,
you didn't think i
would just, like,

317
00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:19.884
leave you hanging,
did ya?

318
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.387
You did, didn't ya?

319
00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:31.395
Right, you lot!
Where are you?

320
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.798
Where are you?
What you doing here,
hiding?

321
00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:39.870
<i> You know what my</i>
<i> life's about right now?</i>

322
00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:42.006
It's all about the blocks,

323
00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:45.776
dirty great towers
that have stood firm
for two generations,

324
00:20:45.778 --> 00:20:49.513
full of initiated kids who'll
be dead before they grow old.

325
00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:52.383
Grim towers and
hopeless kids.

326
00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:16.574
"For the first 10 days
they sailed on beautifully

327
00:21:16.576 --> 00:21:21.445
"and found plenty to eat,
as there was lots of fish.

328
00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:23.914
"And they had only to take
them out of the sea

329
00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:28.586
"with a long spoon when
the quangle wangle..."

330
00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:30.421
What's a quangle wangle?

331
00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.773
God, I miss putting
those kids to bed.

332
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:55.579
And sleeping next
to you, of course.

333
00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:05.122
We gonna go to the
Chelsea ball next week?

334
00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:06.457
No.

335
00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:11.162
Come on...

336
00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:14.065
Do you actually ever stop
to think about why I hate
those events?

337
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.034
They worship you and...

338
00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.403
Don't even notice me.

339
00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:23.074
Well, it is those events
that pay the bills.

340
00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:26.577
Oh, this is new.

341
00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:28.713
Look at you, man.

342
00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.084
What's this about?

343
00:22:33.086 --> 00:22:34.952
Oh, that must have been
the cleaner, I think.

344
00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:36.987
We've been having
a bit of sort out.

345
00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:38.089
It wasn't on purpose.

346
00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:44.495
Ems...

347
00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:47.665
I made a mistake.

348
00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:49.567
You made more than one.

349
00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:51.001
I know I did. I know.

350
00:22:51.003 --> 00:22:54.939
And I'm truly sorry
about it. Okay?

351
00:22:54.941 --> 00:22:56.807
But how long do we have
to keep on going like this?

352
00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:58.776
It's killing me...
It's not a game.

353
00:22:58.778 --> 00:23:01.545
And I'm sure you are
sorry, but I'm not ready.

354
00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:03.447
I need more time.

355
00:23:03.449 --> 00:23:04.849
It's not all about you.

356
00:23:04.851 --> 00:23:06.417
As long as the credit cards
work, though, right?

357
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:08.085
It's about our kids.

358
00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:13.424
And I'm gonna be working soon.
So, I'll have my own money.

359
00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:15.926
I didn't mean that,
like... oh...

360
00:23:15.928 --> 00:23:19.096
I'm sorry about that.
I don't mean that.

361
00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:26.437
Ems, look, I...

362
00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:28.973
I stopped playing.

363
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.777
I lost my parents.

364
00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:34.645
And I'm really
turned round.

365
00:23:34.647 --> 00:23:37.915
All I really had left was
you and my kids, okay?

366
00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.450
And I miss you.

367
00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:42.820
Ems, I'm sorry.

368
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.690
I just want you back.

369
00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:51.996
Ta.

370
00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:53.898
Here, sweetheart.

371
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.702
Cheers, George.
Thank you. Cheers.

372
00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:03.641
<i> Now, the moment you've</i>
<i> all been waiting for.</i>

373
00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:05.843
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

374
00:24:05.845 --> 00:24:08.479
<i> battersea's favorite</i>
<i> singing cabbie, George!</i>

375
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.448
Go on, George!

376
00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:17.755
<i> Good evening, Wembley!</i>

377
00:26:57.716 --> 00:26:59.083
You all right?

378
00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:02.119
I think you should go.

379
00:27:04.522 --> 00:27:06.724
It was a mistake.

380
00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:09.193
You've got what you came for,
and my money's on the counter.

381
00:27:09.195 --> 00:27:11.195
Oh, stop it. Come on.
Let's just talk.

382
00:27:11.197 --> 00:27:12.863
If we could talk,

383
00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:14.932
we wouldn't be
where we are now.

384
00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:18.969
You just treat everything like
it's a match you can't lose.

385
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:21.372
Please... please,
Max, will you go?

386
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.308
A mistake?

387
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:07.117
Darling? Cup of
tea for you there.

388
00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:13.223
Good luck
today, all right?

389
00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:16.060
I got money on
you winning this.

390
00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:19.363
Thanks, love,
but I keep telling ya,
it ain't a bloody race.

391
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:21.331
No.
Of course it ain't.

392
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.068
See you later.

393
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.803
Oh, and don't
you be late.

394
00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:27.171
I won't.

395
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.095
- Excuse me.
- Hold this, yeah?

396
00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:56.700
Dom, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

397
00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:58.802
Get off the man's car!
Thanks. Thank you.

398
00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:01.638
You fucking idiot.
Man, how stupid are you?

399
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.940
Come on, man.
Bruv,

400
00:29:02.942 --> 00:29:04.174
when are you
going to grow up?

401
00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:05.709
How many times
have I told you?

402
00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:07.511
You're supposed to be
selling this, not smoking it,

403
00:29:07.513 --> 00:29:09.780
you little prick.

404
00:29:09.782 --> 00:29:12.783
Where the fuck is
your ped? Huh?

405
00:29:12.785 --> 00:29:15.319
That's... that's all
i could tief, innit?

406
00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:19.523
You're some
dickhead, you know.

407
00:29:19.525 --> 00:29:21.391
Man, this is why you
don't get no chicks.

408
00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:23.460
What? Bruv, you know
i got bare girls.

409
00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:25.062
Man, I got my dick
sucked last night.

410
00:29:25.064 --> 00:29:26.930
What do you know?
Please.

411
00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:29.399
I swear down, bruv.
She sucked me off.

412
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:31.735
She asked why I didn't
have no hair down there.

413
00:29:31.737 --> 00:29:34.605
Told her I had
alopecia. Spot me.

414
00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:36.473
Fucking...

415
00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:46.683
Yo,
make sure you don't
get the bag this time.

416
00:29:46.685 --> 00:29:48.318
Where the fuck
these freshman at?

417
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.254
Been waiting for this
shit all day, cuz.

418
00:29:51.856 --> 00:29:54.458
My young gs.

419
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.761
Tonight's the night.

420
00:29:57.763 --> 00:29:59.329
It's initiation time.

421
00:29:59.331 --> 00:30:02.533
So, you best grab them peds
and ride 'em for real.

422
00:30:02.535 --> 00:30:04.768
Wait till some cunt
flashes you up, yeah?

423
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.304
Then you fuck him up!
You get me?

424
00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.575
Something wrong, Kingsley?

425
00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:13.377
Seriously?

426
00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:15.112
Man, why are we still
troubling them that ain't
on nothin'?

427
00:30:15.114 --> 00:30:16.947
It's about trust
and loyalty, innit?

428
00:30:16.949 --> 00:30:19.216
And don't be thinking
i don't need no proof,
you know.

429
00:30:19.218 --> 00:30:21.685
That's why god
invented the iPhone.

430
00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:23.053
Come on then!

431
00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.229
You still don't fucking
get it, do you?

432
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:34.531
We need the young 'uns out
on the road making dough,

433
00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:37.367
not getting bagged
for some dead crime.

434
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:41.538
Ain't you got somewhere
you're supposed to be?

435
00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:49.279
I don't care how tough
you think you are

436
00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:51.081
or what you've
done to get here

437
00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:53.450
or what you do when
you're not here.

438
00:30:53.452 --> 00:30:54.852
You're here to work.

439
00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:06.296
Don't worry,
love. I'm on me way.
You crack on.

440
00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:11.568
Excuse me?

441
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.304
Mate, sorry.
I'm done for the day.
Your light's on.

442
00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:16.273
I only live
over the bridge.

443
00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:18.542
Go on then, mate. Jump in.

444
00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:25.182
Where you going?
Halsey street, please.

445
00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:42.466
Excuse me?

446
00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.970
Would you mind
giving me a hand?

447
00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:48.805
What?
Hand.

448
00:31:48.807 --> 00:31:50.941
You've got a pair of them
at the end of your arms.

449
00:31:50.943 --> 00:31:53.577
You're supposed to be
paying back your community,
aren't you?

450
00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:00.684
Okay.

451
00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:02.686
There you are.

452
00:32:02.688 --> 00:32:04.221
While you're here,

453
00:32:04.223 --> 00:32:07.858
some mulch would
be most useful.

454
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.359
What's...
Mulch.

455
00:32:09.361 --> 00:32:10.560
Bark mulching.

456
00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:12.562
You've got a mountain
of it beside your hut.

457
00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:14.331
Uh...

458
00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:16.033
I'll make it
worth your while.

459
00:32:16.035 --> 00:32:18.235
Look, man, I'm...
I'm done for the day.

460
00:32:18.237 --> 00:32:19.970
I'm literally
about to roll out.

461
00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.615
You look tired.

462
00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:34.651
You okay?

463
00:32:34.653 --> 00:32:36.153
Yeah, I'm fine.

464
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:40.123
Yeah?
Mmm.

465
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.293
All right, look.

466
00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:46.330
I've got something that
should cheer you up.

467
00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:55.305
Marrakech?
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:57.140
Imagine it,
the two of us,

469
00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:59.009
we'll actually be
rocking the casabah.

470
00:32:59.011 --> 00:33:01.244
Listen, Jake, I can't.
Only for two nights.

471
00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.679
I can't just
bugger off on a whim.

472
00:33:02.681 --> 00:33:05.549
I'm not a student anymore.
It's two nights.

473
00:33:05.551 --> 00:33:07.918
The kids have got stuff on.
I've got work on.

474
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.653
And... and I've got
to think about Max.

475
00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:11.388
Ugh, Max!

476
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.590
Max. Why's it
always about Max?

477
00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:15.826
Emily, he's fucked you over.
Why can't you see that?

478
00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:17.327
Don't be like that, Jake.

479
00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:19.763
It's not a competition
between you two.

480
00:33:19.765 --> 00:33:22.432
I really don't
need this at the moment.

481
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.004
It was a nice
thought, though.

482
00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.681
Good man.

483
00:33:37.683 --> 00:33:39.750
You moved quicker
than you have done
all afternoon.

484
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.421
Here's a thank you
for your kindness.

485
00:33:44.423 --> 00:33:47.557
Oh, no, no, man. It's cool.
I don't want your money.

486
00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:51.428
A good deed brightens
a dark world.

487
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:56.400
So, would you like me
to do anything else for
you while I'm here?

488
00:33:56.402 --> 00:33:58.135
Two curses of
the modern world,

489
00:33:58.137 --> 00:34:01.138
sarcasm and the
empty gesture.

490
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.640
No, you're all
done for today.

491
00:34:03.642 --> 00:34:06.376
Save your next
job for tomorrow.

492
00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:13.750
We pay all the taxes
and we're the bloody pariahs.

493
00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:16.686
There are jobs. People
don't want to work.

494
00:34:16.688 --> 00:34:19.122
You know, if it wasn't
for people like me,

495
00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:21.792
this country would
be totally fucked.

496
00:34:21.794 --> 00:34:24.061
Big night out, was it?

497
00:34:24.063 --> 00:34:25.328
Oh, fucking hell!

498
00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.502
What the fuck?

499
00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.772
Love, you all right?

500
00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:38.642
Love? You all right?

501
00:34:38.644 --> 00:34:41.411
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.

502
00:34:41.413 --> 00:34:45.382
Darling, you okay?
Darling? Love?

503
00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:50.854
You seen, mate.
She just stepped
out in front of me.

504
00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:53.657
I... have you got a
phone? Ring an ambulance.

505
00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.259
Anyone know first aid?
I... I don't know what to do.

506
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:57.794
I don't know
what to do.

507
00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:03.166
<i> Can you hear me?</i>

508
00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:11.308
What you
are doing here today by
giving up your time

509
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.076
and raising
sponsorship money

510
00:35:13.078 --> 00:35:16.680
will make a lot
of children's lives
so much better.

511
00:35:16.682 --> 00:35:18.982
So, thank you so
much for doing this.

512
00:35:18.984 --> 00:35:20.517
I hope you have
a great day.

513
00:35:20.519 --> 00:35:23.019
And off you go,
on the three.

514
00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:25.522
One, two, three!

515
00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:42.139
I was sitting in
the back seat...

516
00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:26.550
Where the hell
are you? I did it.

517
00:36:26.552 --> 00:36:29.753
Now, get your slippery, fat
ass here and take me home.

518
00:36:29.755 --> 00:36:32.489
Well, we might as well
have a quick drink first.

519
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.626
Hey, we did it, yeah!

520
00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:43.360
Kingsley. I went by
the graveyard, fam.

521
00:37:43.362 --> 00:37:44.828
Boss man said you'd
left, though, innit.

522
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.364
How's it picking up
them weeds, though, fam?

523
00:37:47.366 --> 00:37:49.766
Must be long still.
Oi, you tell Jules yet?

524
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:51.301
Nah, man, that's
my business.

525
00:37:51.303 --> 00:37:53.036
That don't affect
big man's business.

526
00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:55.138
Yeah, I know, but
he's mad para, innit?

527
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.208
About feds and snitching,
fam. Need to fix up...

528
00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.709
Why the fuck you
always setting shit?

529
00:37:59.711 --> 00:38:01.978
Jules knows I'm the one
that brings in the piece.

530
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.048
You're just the muscle.
Some innie knucklehead.

531
00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.518
And to think you used
to be someone to me, man.

532
00:38:12.858 --> 00:38:14.658
You know, there's more
to life than the blocks

533
00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.026
and messing with
the youngers.

534
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.454
Hey...

535
00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:19.389
You're embarrassing me!

536
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:21.057
You're embarrassing me!

537
00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.914
All right, granddad?

538
00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.893
No, no...

539
00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:38.835
Mom!

540
00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.372
Just give me your keys.
What?

541
00:40:42.374 --> 00:40:43.706
Mom, what you being
like this for?

542
00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.476
Mom!
I found it.

543
00:40:46.478 --> 00:40:48.478
Give me your keys.
Hey, mom, mom,
calm down.

544
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.614
Let me explain.
Keys, now!

545
00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.082
Wait, listen to me, mom.

546
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:55.785
Mom!

547
00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:03.793
Mom.

548
00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:08.865
Fuck.

549
00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:16.973
All right, thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen.

550
00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:22.111
And here, oh, listen,
yeah... here, look...

551
00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:25.515
I will... I will sort
you out, all right?

552
00:41:25.517 --> 00:41:27.317
Here's my business card.

553
00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:29.519
I will make
sure... oh...

554
00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.922
Let's get rid of that. Uh...

555
00:41:32.924 --> 00:41:35.558
Look, but no.
Tickets, eh?

556
00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.759
You know I'll
sort you out.

557
00:41:36.761 --> 00:41:39.195
So, there you go.
Thank you.

558
00:41:39.197 --> 00:41:43.199
Max, you were a legend,
mate. Sort yourself out.

559
00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:48.071
Yeah, well...

560
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:53.276
I can't be a legend

561
00:41:53.278 --> 00:41:54.811
because I'm not dead yet.

562
00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.581
Go on.
Go to bed.

563
00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.692
Ooh!

564
00:43:11.823 --> 00:43:13.089
<i> Hiya.</i>

565
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:15.258
Hey. It's me.

566
00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.577
Oh, fuck.

567
00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:40.049
What's going on?

568
00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:44.187
Um... I gotta
go, all right?

569
00:43:44.189 --> 00:43:45.655
I'll call you later.

570
00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:59.035
Shit.

571
00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.984
Was this your pops?

572
00:44:47.986 --> 00:44:50.787
Oh, no, no.
No, it was an old friend.

573
00:44:50.789 --> 00:44:52.955
You could call
him my mentor.

574
00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:56.859
There's nothing
I'm doing right now

575
00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:58.327
that I'd even want to
put on there, you know.

576
00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:05.401
Well, keep in mind that
all our lives amount to

577
00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:10.506
is that little dash
on your headstone

578
00:45:10.508 --> 00:45:13.309
between the date of your
birth and your death.

579
00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:19.148
That stands for everything
we ever were.

580
00:46:18.008 --> 00:46:20.910
<i> Well, that was a full-blooded</i>
<i> 40 minutes, wasn't it?</i>

581
00:46:20.912 --> 00:46:22.612
<i> Max, as a former</i>
<i> international captain,</i>

582
00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:24.680
<i> you must have</i>
<i> just loved it.</i>

583
00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:27.216
<i> I thought that the...</i>

584
00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:29.886
<i> Very entertaining</i>
<i> first half, you know?</i>

585
00:46:29.888 --> 00:46:32.622
<i> The, um...</i>
<i> Both packs...</i>

586
00:46:32.624 --> 00:46:34.624
<i> Uh, dominant.</i>

587
00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:38.961
<i> And, um... oh...</i>

588
00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:41.264
<i> Okay,</i>
<i> we'll come back to</i>
<i> you in just a sec.</i>

589
00:46:41.266 --> 00:46:43.065
<i> Kyran, what were</i>
<i> your thoughts?</i>

590
00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:56.512
Yeah, it was
very entertaining.
The first minute, the try...

591
00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:59.515
Probably the quickest try
in international rugby
we've ever seen.

592
00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:03.286
So as Max has said,
just got to make sure that
we keep the tempers down.

593
00:47:03.288 --> 00:47:04.720
I think the referee's
doing a good job.

594
00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:05.888
<i> The yellow card</i>
<i> is probably</i>

595
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.790
<i> the right thing</i>
<i> to keep it calm.</i>

596
00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:09.725
<i> Huge audience</i>
<i> watching. It's not just...</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

597
00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:11.561
<i> What the fuck you doing, Max?</i>

598
00:47:11.563 --> 00:47:13.563
<i> You need to take a good look</i>
<i> in the mirror, seriously.</i>

599
00:47:13.565 --> 00:47:16.399
<i> Do you know how many people</i>
<i> were watching this?</i>

600
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:18.134
<i> Millions,</i>
<i> that's how many.</i>

601
00:47:18.136 --> 00:47:20.803
Jerome. Mate, listen...

602
00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:24.340
<i> No, just go home and</i>
<i> call me when you're</i>
<i> compos mentis, okay?</i>

603
00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:49.265
<i> It ain't</i>
<i> some big conspiracy,</i>

604
00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:51.167
<i> and it ain't no cover-up.</i>

605
00:47:51.169 --> 00:47:54.270
Shit just happens,
and you just
gotta accept that.

606
00:47:54.272 --> 00:47:57.206
They say everyone's equal
in the eyes of the law,

607
00:47:57.208 --> 00:48:00.142
but that don't mean the law
treats everyone equally.

608
00:48:00.144 --> 00:48:03.946
Injustice, natural disasters,
9/11, the war on terror.

609
00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:07.016
Shit just happens, man.

610
00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:12.021
Yeah, I... I mean,
like, it's not a poem
or a rap or anything.

611
00:48:12.023 --> 00:48:14.156
It's... I just got some
shit to say, you know?

612
00:48:14.158 --> 00:48:16.058
Well, whatever it is,

613
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.361
it's spoken like
a true professional.

614
00:48:18.363 --> 00:48:20.596
Yeah, well,
I've been writing.

615
00:48:20.598 --> 00:48:22.832
Them headphones are hard,
you know?

616
00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:25.801
Better than mine,
at least.
Well...

617
00:48:25.803 --> 00:48:27.069
What are you listening to?

618
00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:28.938
Here you are.

619
00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:33.409
Hey, what?

620
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:35.945
Nina Simone, yeah?
All right.

621
00:48:35.947 --> 00:48:37.680
This is my mom's
kind of shit, you know.

622
00:48:39.217 --> 00:48:41.117
"Please don't
let be misunderstood."

623
00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:43.352
Written for her in 1964.

624
00:48:43.354 --> 00:48:44.620
I was 10.

625
00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:52.194
I say what you need
is a room of one's own,

626
00:48:52.196 --> 00:48:55.564
somewhere to write,
somewhere where you
can be inspired.

627
00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:00.336
I think it's high time
you joined me on the beach.

628
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.484
<i> Hey, it's me.</i>

629
00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:51.554
<i> Um, I just called</i>
<i> to check you're okay</i>

630
00:49:51.556 --> 00:49:55.124
<i> and say sorry</i>
<i> I was a bit harsh</i>
<i> the other night.</i>

631
00:49:55.126 --> 00:49:57.159
<i> Oh, yeah, and Evie</i>
<i> wanted to say hi.</i>

632
00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:59.028
<i>- Go on.</i>
<i>- Hi, daddy.</i>

633
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.297
<i> Where are you?</i>
<i> I miss you, daddy.</i>

634
00:50:01.299 --> 00:50:03.666
<i> And Leo's being</i>
<i> a real pain.</i>

635
00:50:03.668 --> 00:50:07.269
<i> He took one of my hair clips</i>
<i> and put it in the bin.</i>

636
00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:08.671
<i> And now I can't find it,</i>

637
00:50:08.673 --> 00:50:10.506
<i> and he won't help me</i>
<i> look for it.</i>

638
00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:12.742
<i> Okay, Evie,</i>
<i> that's enough.</i>

639
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:16.178
<i> Call us back</i>
<i> when you can, okay?</i>

640
00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:10.499
Hey, who's that?

641
00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:15.504
Say, granddad,

642
00:51:15.506 --> 00:51:17.273
you look like
you trying to get to
home or something?

643
00:51:17.275 --> 00:51:19.708
Listen, you got the time?

644
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.777
Uh, no.

645
00:51:21.779 --> 00:51:23.212
Come on, you must have
a cigarette for me

646
00:51:23.214 --> 00:51:24.713
or something
or I can get a split.

647
00:51:24.715 --> 00:51:26.248
Or a chip.

648
00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.717
Listen, pops.
My guy.

649
00:51:28.719 --> 00:51:30.352
Don't worry,
we're not going to,
like, steal your shit.

650
00:51:30.354 --> 00:51:31.921
Just being, um, friendly.

651
00:51:31.923 --> 00:51:35.458
Sorry, I didn't get that.
Oh, he's taking the piss.

652
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.395
Friendly. Anyways,
what you listening to?

653
00:51:39.397 --> 00:51:41.697
Let me check these out.
No. I don't think so.

654
00:51:43.534 --> 00:51:45.634
Oh, hey, man's got
a new iPod n'at.

655
00:51:45.636 --> 00:51:47.002
Man's up to date
with his shit.

656
00:51:47.004 --> 00:51:49.538
Up to date.

657
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.141
Say, we give this guy
a dre beats or what?

658
00:51:52.143 --> 00:51:53.742
Yeah, fuck it.
Come on.

659
00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.212
Trying to diss me, pops?

660
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.714
- Yeah?
- Let him go!

661
00:51:58.716 --> 00:52:01.484
Yeah, eff him up.
What are
you doing? Stop!

662
00:52:01.486 --> 00:52:03.719
Fuck him up.

663
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:08.824
Fucking dissing me, pops?

664
00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:12.728
Stop him! Stop!

665
00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:21.337
Let it go, bruv.
Let it go.

666
00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:22.705
Why'd you stop recording?
Daniel'll be proud.

667
00:52:22.707 --> 00:52:25.908
Fuck that, man! Beat!
We gotta go, bruv!

668
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:27.543
Fuck this old fuck.

669
00:53:35.146 --> 00:53:36.812
- I won!
- My turn.

670
00:53:38.149 --> 00:53:40.182
There you are.

671
00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:42.785
Bells, bells,
could you just take
that in for one sec?

672
00:53:42.787 --> 00:53:45.120
- I'll be a minute.
- Hey.

673
00:53:45.122 --> 00:53:46.622
What are you doing?

674
00:53:46.624 --> 00:53:47.890
I'm sorry.
You've not been
taking my calls.

675
00:53:47.892 --> 00:53:49.225
Yeah, I've been busy.

676
00:53:49.227 --> 00:53:50.793
You can't just turn up here
without a warning.

677
00:53:50.795 --> 00:53:54.096
I know. I know. I know.
You know that.

678
00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:58.200
But I just put
together some photos,
old-school style,

679
00:53:58.202 --> 00:54:00.903
and I thought
you might like it.

680
00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.039
That's really sweet, Jake.

681
00:54:04.041 --> 00:54:06.942
I've just got too much
to think about right now.

682
00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:08.811
Yeah.

683
00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.614
We've always been

684
00:54:11.616 --> 00:54:12.881
so good together,
you know?

685
00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:14.917
And we missed
our chance before,

686
00:54:14.919 --> 00:54:17.686
and I just don't want
us to miss it again.

687
00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:20.823
What's happened?

688
00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:23.692
Emily, you're not
back with him.

689
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:31.800
I love you.

690
00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.404
I think I've always
loved you, probably.

691
00:54:35.406 --> 00:54:37.106
Since the first time
that I met you.

692
00:54:37.108 --> 00:54:40.843
Jake, please.
Don't. Please.

693
00:54:40.845 --> 00:54:46.482
I did... I warned you.
It's just too complicated.

694
00:54:46.484 --> 00:54:51.053
And you know my
life's more than just
kisses and playlists.

695
00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:55.791
I'm sorry.

696
00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:28.357
Hey, I've been looking
all over the place for you.

697
00:55:28.359 --> 00:55:30.225
You didn't say...

698
00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:31.627
Hey, what the fuck?

699
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.131
Ah, some kids, you know.

700
00:55:36.133 --> 00:55:38.600
They wanted my headphones.

701
00:55:38.602 --> 00:55:40.235
It was my own fault.

702
00:55:40.237 --> 00:55:41.603
It was late.
It was getting dark.

703
00:55:41.605 --> 00:55:43.038
What'd they look like?
Just kids.

704
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.307
And... and you're not
hunting them down.

705
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:49.445
Nah, man...
That's not your
life any longer.

706
00:55:54.652 --> 00:55:58.554
You've been to hospital?
No. I'm all right, honestly.

707
00:55:58.556 --> 00:56:01.590
No, it's just cuts.
Bruises, you know, just...

708
00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:08.063
Thirty years
in one square mile.

709
00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:12.301
Not so much
as a stolen wallet.

710
00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:19.775
But in the greater
scheme of things,

711
00:56:19.777 --> 00:56:21.443
doesn't really
matter anyway.

712
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.684
"A thousand
landmarks perish

713
00:56:28.686 --> 00:56:31.954
"a hundred streets

"he changes not at all."

722
00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:04.853
I wasn't sure if
i was going to see you

723
00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:08.223
until your next
misdemeanor.

724
00:57:08.225 --> 00:57:11.126
So I've been...

725
00:57:11.128 --> 00:57:14.963
Carrying this around.

726
00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:24.740
There's a phone number.

727
00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:27.843
Call that person and
tell them I sent you.

728
00:57:27.845 --> 00:57:29.344
Thanks.

729
00:57:29.346 --> 00:57:32.714
And breathe, remember.
Yeah.

730
00:57:32.716 --> 00:57:37.352
Hey, go get yourself
checked out, okay?

731
00:57:37.354 --> 00:57:40.622
Breathe from deep within.

732
00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:43.759
All right.
See you later, yeah?

733
00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.743
What's this then, bruv?
Move, man.

734
00:58:01.745 --> 00:58:04.046
Was that a
love letter, fam?
My business.

735
00:58:04.048 --> 00:58:06.548
Your business
is my business, cuz.

736
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:08.050
Big man Jules wants
to see you anyways.

737
00:58:08.052 --> 00:58:10.752
What?
Why's he telling you?

738
00:58:10.754 --> 00:58:12.688
What you been saying?

739
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.056
Nothin', fam.

740
00:58:14.058 --> 00:58:17.125
I'm just a knucklehead.
Remember that.

741
00:58:17.127 --> 00:58:18.727
Best go see him, though.

742
00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:05.240
<i> Okay,</i>
<i> then, Kingsley,</i>

743
00:59:05.242 --> 00:59:07.609
what monologue are you
going to do for us today?

744
00:59:07.611 --> 00:59:09.211
It's called<i> the bush.</i>

745
00:59:09.213 --> 00:59:12.748
It's... it's from
the Australian film
<i> animal kingdom,</i>

746
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.183
but I kind of made up
my own version,

747
00:59:15.185 --> 00:59:16.752
if that's
all right, I mean...

748
00:59:16.754 --> 00:59:19.087
Yeah!
Sounds perfect.

749
00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:21.223
Okay.

750
00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:29.531
You know what the
blocks are about?

751
00:59:29.533 --> 00:59:33.135
It's about dirty towers
that have stood firm
for two generations,

752
00:59:33.137 --> 00:59:36.538
and kids who'll die
before they grow old.

753
00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.541
Grim towers
and hopeless kids.

754
00:59:39.543 --> 00:59:42.611
<i> And everybody knows</i>
<i> their place in the</i>
<i> scheme of things.</i>

755
00:59:42.613 --> 00:59:46.882
<i> Everything, everyone, sits</i>
<i> in the order of the blocks.</i>

756
00:59:46.884 --> 00:59:49.985
<i> Now, some survive</i>
<i> 'cause they're strong,</i>

757
00:59:49.987 --> 00:59:51.887
<i> and there are those</i>
<i> who are weak,</i>

758
00:59:51.889 --> 00:59:54.923
<i> but they survive</i>
<i> 'cause they're being</i>
<i> protected by the strong.</i>

759
00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.226
<i> See, because of the</i>
<i> circles I move in,</i>

760
00:59:58.228 --> 01:00:01.196
I thought I was
one of the strong ones.

761
01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:04.533
But I'm not.

762
01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:06.635
I'm one of the weak ones.

763
01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.036
And the only reason
I've survived

764
01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:10.272
is 'cause I'm being
protected by the strong.

765
01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.143
Run like Kingsley.

766
01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:17.012
Long time, brother.

767
01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:20.449
Yeah, man. We saying
you good, yeah?

768
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:21.783
Mmm.

769
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.053
Sit down then.

770
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:37.966
We've been hearing you got
some issues and you want out.

771
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.768
All of a sudden
you're better than us?

772
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.036
Yo, no, man, come on,
it's not even like that...

773
01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.739
- So, what is it like then?
- Yo.

774
01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.107
Give the man
a minute, Vincent.

775
01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:47.342
He just got here.

776
01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:49.211
<i> But they're</i>
<i> not strong anymore,</i>

777
01:00:49.213 --> 01:00:51.113
<i> and they can't</i>
<i> protect me now.</i>

778
01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.649
But in life,
you always have an out.

779
01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:54.916
The thing is,
the less you have,

780
01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:57.119
the higher the price
you have to pay.

781
01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:00.122
A boss needs to
keep control, yeah?

782
01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:04.359
And if you lose respect,
that's a problem, innit?

783
01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:05.560
Yeah.

784
01:01:05.562 --> 01:01:07.129
Bad for business.

785
01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.966
Now, I know you got
yourself pinched,

786
01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:12.868
but I also know
that your boy Daniel

787
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.170
has been talking
to the police.

788
01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.572
And so what do you say?

789
01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:19.908
Am I dealing with,
like, a little coup
from within here?

790
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.010
No, no, no.
No way.

791
01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.713
Look, I've known Daniel
my entire life.

792
01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.148
He's a lot of things,
but he ain't no snitch.

793
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.051
It's a fact, and
this ain't some
muggy 9:00 to 5:00

794
01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:31.887
where you can just
hand in your notice.

795
01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:33.989
You can try
and leave this life,

796
01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.724
but this life
will never leave you.

797
01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:37.392
Very poetic.
Thank you, Vincent.

798
01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:42.297
Hey, look, I've got a soldier
who's ready to step up.

799
01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:45.033
Nothing will change
for you, man.

800
01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.302
I can vouch for him.

801
01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.876
All right.

802
01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:57.279
All right.

803
01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:02.117
Got a very simple
proposition for you.

804
01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.056
The weed on your path

805
01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:11.359
to a better life
has to be gone.

806
01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.029
You understand?

807
01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.475
You still got
that gun I gave you?

808
01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.978
Kind of.

809
01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.013
Someone's looking after it
for me, innit?

810
01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.784
Well, someone better
give you it back.

811
01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:44.359
We won't meet this new man
till Daniel's gone.

812
01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.795
Am I clear?

813
01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:03.979
Am I clear?

814
01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:07.916
Am I clear on the price
i have to pay

815
01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:09.985
to leave
my old life behind?

816
01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:12.354
Yeah.

817
01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:13.822
I am.

818
01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.957
Crystal clear.

819
01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:20.929
So, how do you
know Terence?

820
01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:24.232
Oh, we live in the same
area, so, you know.

821
01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:26.902
Do you live
with your parents?

822
01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:29.337
I did live with my
mom until recently.

823
01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:32.574
But I kind of
moved on, still.

824
01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.242
And my dad...

825
01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.711
Boy, I ain't seen
that guy in time.

826
01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:40.515
That man got a new family.
I guess he moved on as well.

827
01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.752
I'm sorry to hear that.

828
01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:45.220
I didn't mean to pry.

829
01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:47.823
Nah, nah, it's cool.
It's no biggie.

830
01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.393
Yeah, anyway,
i better get going.

831
01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:52.894
I'll see you tomorrow.

832
01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.263
Final audition.

833
01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:58.266
Oh, yeah. Yeah, all right.
Cool, all right.

834
01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.402
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

835
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.350
There he is!
There he is!

836
01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.885
There's daddy.
Go on.

837
01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:19.020
You want to say hi?
There's my monsters!

838
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.022
Come here.

839
01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.757
Come here, you two.

840
01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:24.593
I've missed you
so much, so much.

841
01:04:24.595 --> 01:04:26.995
- You going to go play, yeah?
- Yeah.

842
01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.497
You're early for once.

843
01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:31.132
Yeah, I've been running.

844
01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:32.868
Like the old days.

845
01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:35.637
You look different.

846
01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:38.373
Do I?
Mmm.

847
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.242
No, I'm just me.

848
01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:46.715
It's good that you're
straightening yourself out.

849
01:04:46.717 --> 01:04:49.885
I heard about
the nosebleed.

850
01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:52.587
Do you mind if we get
a photo, Max?

851
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:54.522
Uh... no, not today, mate.

852
01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:56.758
I'm just with the family,
okay, yeah?

853
01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.126
Cheers.
No worries.

854
01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:04.466
No, I just want
to concentrate on
being a good dad.

855
01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:07.636
Come and play, daddy!

856
01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:10.639
All right then.

857
01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.241
Oh, man.

858
01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.178
Here I come!

859
01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.851
<i> For Chris and Samantha,</i>

860
01:05:22.853 --> 01:05:26.488
<i> having a large garden is top</i>
<i> of their list of priorities.</i>

861
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:29.291
<i> With three growing boys</i>
<i> and one more on the way,</i>

862
01:05:29.293 --> 01:05:31.426
<i> space to run around</i>
<i> is essential.</i>

863
01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:34.829
<i> The first property I've found</i>
<i> ticks all of those boxes.</i>

864
01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:36.865
<i> A little too far</i>
<i> out of town.</i>

865
01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:38.266
<i> So, guys,</i>
<i> what do you think?</i>

866
01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.935
<i> Oh,</i>
<i> it's absolutely gorgeous.</i>

867
01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.304
<i> Oh, it's so lovely...</i>

868
01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:48.643
Come on, George,
you've been sat in that
chair all day again.

869
01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:51.112
And you ain't touched
the lunch I left.

870
01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:56.918
Right, we need to
get you out of here.

871
01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.855
You've got five minutes,
you best pull
yourself together.

872
01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:02.490
I mean it, George.
Five minutes.

873
01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:17.205
You remember
what happened here
nearly 20 years ago?

874
01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:20.108
Yeah.
Course I do.

875
01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:25.347
You got down on one knee
and promised me the world.

876
01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.416
And you delivered.

877
01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.286
Maybe not the big house
full of kids.

878
01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:36.057
But you told me
you'd be my rock forever.

879
01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.431
And you have, George.

880
01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.301
Really, you have.

881
01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:56.244
But I've made my decision.

882
01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.480
We can't bring
a kid into all this.

883
01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.218
We can't do it right now.

884
01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.324
We may never be able to.

885
01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:11.359
I know what I'm saying, and...

886
01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:14.462
And I'm all right with it.

887
01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:17.365
Sweetheart, you know...
No, just let me finish.

888
01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.274
You know
I've always wanted a kid,

889
01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:29.244
and as much as it's hurt
over the years...

890
01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:36.618
With me mum going on
and all my friends having 'em.

891
01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:41.056
If I'm given a choice

892
01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.826
of getting my husband back,

893
01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:48.096
or getting a new baby,

894
01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.902
I'd pick you

895
01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:55.336
every time.

896
01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:00.375
I just want my rock back.

897
01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.421
It was an accident, love,

898
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.391
plain and simple.

899
01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.335
I know.
I know.

900
01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:02.470
Sorry to keep you
waiting so long.
That's all right.

901
01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:05.673
Um... I've got bad news,
I'm afraid.

902
01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:09.410
Terence died this morning.

903
01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:14.449
What do you mean
he's dead? He...

904
01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:17.285
No, he can't be,
i saw him just...

905
01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:18.753
I'm so sorry.

906
01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.091
How?

907
01:09:23.093 --> 01:09:24.592
Is this from when
he was robbed?

908
01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:30.331
He had internal bleeding,
so he didn't know, and...

909
01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:32.300
I kept telling him to go
to hospital, but he just...

910
01:09:32.302 --> 01:09:34.702
He said he was fine, man!

911
01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.071
Fuck!

912
01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.509
Fine!

913
01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:19.414
Yo, kings!

914
01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:21.382
I was looking for
you everywhere.

915
01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:26.354
You okay, yeah?
Yeah, man.

916
01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:28.223
Just had a bit of
bad news, that's all.

917
01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:29.691
What, Jules?

918
01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:32.994
Nah, nah, nah, just some
shit in my other world.

919
01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:34.662
He wants to meet, though.

920
01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.298
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

921
01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.269
What, you sure
he's gonna trust me?

922
01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:42.537
Yeah, man,
don't watch that.

923
01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:43.838
He knows you've been
my boy for time.

924
01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.940
Nice.

925
01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:51.412
You're gonna be
on your own now, though.

926
01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.581
You sure you're gonna
be cool with that?

927
01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:57.819
Yeah, man, I've been
on my own for time.

928
01:10:57.821 --> 01:11:00.154
No more looking
in the rearview.

929
01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:02.390
Your man's got
a future on you now.

930
01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:05.360
What about Daniel?

931
01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:08.029
Yeah, I've still got
to take care of that, man.

932
01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:13.635
Man should've knows
who he's dealing with!

933
01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:16.170
Oh, shit, what brings you
round these days, cuz?

934
01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.672
I thought

935
01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.440
Yo, Jules wants you gone,
fam. He don't trust you.

936
01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:20.775
He thinks you're
working with the feds.

937
01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.377
What you been
smoking, cuz?

938
01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:23.711
Yo, this ain't
no joke, tin man.

939
01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:24.912
He knows you ain't
been nicked.

940
01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:26.347
You need to leave
the ends now.

941
01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:27.782
I can't just leave
like that, cuz.

942
01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.485
You okay, d?
Yo, fuck off, little man.

943
01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.554
Where the fuck you
get these from, bruv?

944
01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:35.890
Ooh, these are mine.
What?

945
01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:38.459
<i> Let me</i>
<i> check these out.</i>
<i> No, I don't think so.</i>

946
01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.565
Get the fuck off, man!

947
01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:55.043
You nearly fucking
killed our boy, cuz!

948
01:11:55.045 --> 01:11:56.110
That ain't our boy!

949
01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:57.478
And we ain't
on nuttin' no more!

950
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.813
What the fuck
you talking about, fam?

951
01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:00.415
Watch too many movies
or something, cuz?

952
01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:02.083
You see what these
little cunts do to
impress you?

953
01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.452
I ain't their boss, fam!

954
01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:06.321
Seriously, man,
i can't have you
fucking with my future.

955
01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.786
Hello!

956
01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.590
Anybody home?

957
01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.992
No?

958
01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:46.761
Just as I planned it.

959
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.004
Where do you keep
your vases?

960
01:12:57.006 --> 01:12:59.640
Ah-ha. Beautiful.

961
01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.078
Mmm.

962
01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:02.737
Fuck!

963
01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:18.085
Come on.
Pick up the phone.

964
01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:21.088
Can we buy daddy
a present?
Yes, we can, Evie,

965
01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.990
but we've got to be quick
because we've got to get back.

966
01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.892
Shall we call daddy?
See if he's at home?
Yeah.

967
01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.194
Then we'll know
what he wants.

968
01:14:26.196 --> 01:14:27.628
Oh, shit,
the battery's dead.

969
01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:29.163
What did I tell you, Leo?

970
01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:31.499
If you play those games,
the battery's going to die.

971
01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:34.302
Yeah, you've got
to listen to mommy.

972
01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:59.060
Fucking slag.
You fucking slag.

973
01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:23.851
Oh, uh, hello, is that Simon?

974
01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.686
Yeah, it's...
It's George radford.

975
01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.889
The cab driver.

976
01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.791
I tried to
call before, yeah.

977
01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:34.562
Yeah. Yeah, you know.

978
01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.332
Listen, I... I know
it might be too soon,

979
01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:41.435
but I was wondering
if maybe we could meet up?

980
01:15:41.437 --> 01:15:43.271
I won't take up much
of your time,

981
01:15:43.273 --> 01:15:47.308
and I totally understand
if it's not something
you want to do.

982
01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:52.046
What, today?

983
01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.181
Yeah, are you sure?

984
01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.450
All right, great.

985
01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:59.987
All right, Simon, thank you.
I'll... I'll see you there.

986
01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:02.256
Ta.

987
01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:10.631
Yeah, if it was you,

988
01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:12.733
I'd want to meet the
geezer that done it.

989
01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:22.143
Right, what shall
we get daddy then?

990
01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:24.845
Some headphones because
i remember breaking them.

991
01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:27.815
Did you break them?
Well, let's see.

992
01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:29.717
I don't know where they are.

993
01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:33.387
Look, mommy,
our house is on TV.

994
01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.289
I'm not so sure, Leo.

995
01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:40.461
Okay, kids, come on.

996
01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:41.629
Come on,
we're going to go now.

997
01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:43.798
Come with me.

998
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.835
A siege is now developing
here in southwest London.

999
01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:49.704
The rugby captain,

1000
01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:51.939
former england rugby
captain Max Moore
is armed with a shotgun...

1001
01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:55.142
<i> Max, put down the gun</i>
<i> and pick up the phone!</i>

1002
01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.114
That's right.

1003
01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:04.418
<i> Max!</i>
<i> Please pick up the phone!</i>

1004
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.787
I ain't fucking talking
to none of you pussyholes

1005
01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:09.323
until I fucking
see my wife.

1006
01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:12.059
Fucking see my wife.

1007
01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:14.195
Where is she?
Where's my wife?

1008
01:17:14.197 --> 01:17:17.732
I want my wife!
Get my wife out here now!

1009
01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:20.134
We don't think that this...
Come one, you could've
shot me by now!

1010
01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:22.370
I'm standing right here!
Look at me!

1011
01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:24.338
Police
are certainly here...

1012
01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.707
What, are you afraid
to pull the trigger?

1013
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:29.777
Why haven't you shot, eh?
Are you scared?

1014
01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.946
Because I'm not!

1015
01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.922
What happened, exactly?

1016
01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.295
I was on my way home.

1017
01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:50.498
It was the last fare
of the day.

1018
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.068
I had this fella in the back.
I almost didn't pick him up.

1019
01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.240
He was going on and on.

1020
01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:04.045
Then this woman just...

1021
01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:05.312
She just pulled out
in front of me.

1022
01:18:05.314 --> 01:18:06.747
She didn't even look.

1023
01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.418
So, I swerved
to avoid her.

1024
01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.256
And, uh...

1025
01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:17.391
And that's when
i hit your wife.

1026
01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:26.067
Tell me one thing.

1027
01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.169
Was she smiling?

1028
01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.638
What?

1029
01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.842
Ruth, when it happened,
was she smiling?

1030
01:18:34.844 --> 01:18:37.178
Sorry, I don't understand
what you mean.

1031
01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.281
When she crossed
the road...

1032
01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.350
Did she look happy?

1033
01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.593
Yeah.

1034
01:18:52.595 --> 01:18:54.295
Yeah, she looked
very happy.

1035
01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:09.543
Actually, just walking
past me now is Emily.

1036
01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:11.112
Emily, you're live on sky.

1037
01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:12.580
Do you think we might have
a very quick word with you?

1038
01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:14.915
That's my house, that's my...
That's my husband!

1039
01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.383
I need to talk to him!

1040
01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:18.686
I need to talk to him.

1041
01:19:18.688 --> 01:19:22.757
<i> Please put down the gun</i>
<i> and pick up the phone!</i>

1042
01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:24.225
Move back now!

1043
01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:28.662
Look, hey,
I'm not fucking speaking...

1044
01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:30.131
<i> Hi, Max, it's Emily.</i>

1045
01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:31.999
Max, what's going on?

1046
01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.834
Why the fuck
have you got a gun?

1047
01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:35.503
Where the fuck have
you been all day?
You fucking betrayed me.

1048
01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:37.738
And if I want
to fucking talk to you,

1049
01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.106
but you just
fucking betray me,

1050
01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:40.541
<i> is that what's going on?</i>
I don't understand.

1051
01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:41.876
Who... who are you mad at?

1052
01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:43.144
Who the fuck am I mad at?

1053
01:19:43.146 --> 01:19:44.845
You fucking fucked
that little prick!

1054
01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:47.848
<i> Why did you</i>
<i> have to fucking do</i>
<i> all of that shit?</i>

1055
01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:49.150
It's gonna end today,
darling.

1056
01:19:49.152 --> 01:19:51.385
It's gonna end you, me,
and that little prick!

1057
01:19:51.387 --> 01:19:54.021
Bring him up here!
Bring him out!

1058
01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:50.244
Why did you have
to fucking run away
with college boy, yeah?

1059
01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:51.679
Because I'm not
a fucking romantic man?

1060
01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:54.148
Mr. fucking romantic!
Mr. fucking college boy?

1061
01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:56.984
I'm not him?
I fucking work hard!

1062
01:20:56.986 --> 01:20:58.752
I live in the
fucking real world

1063
01:20:58.754 --> 01:21:00.454
where you have
to fucking work.

1064
01:21:00.456 --> 01:21:03.624
And I work and I fucking pay,
and I fucking sacrifice!

1065
01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:05.392
All right, you're fucking...

1066
01:21:05.394 --> 01:21:07.294
Now you're pregnant
with this stupid cunt.
You're pregnant!

1067
01:21:07.296 --> 01:21:09.997
<i> Why didn't you fucking</i>
<i> just tell me that?</i>

1068
01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:13.901
Hi, Kath.
Don't know where you got to.

1069
01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:16.070
I've been trying to
call you all day.

1070
01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:19.840
Uh, anyway, I did it.
I'm back in the cab.

1071
01:21:19.842 --> 01:21:22.142
Same old chaos out here.

1072
01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:23.310
Bell me when you
get this, though,
yeah?

1073
01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:25.012
Let me know
you're all right.

1074
01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:26.981
See you later. Bye.

1075
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:43.264
What the fuck?

1076
01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:44.632
Look, I didn't know
what I wanted then,

1077
01:21:44.634 --> 01:21:46.734
and I was getting
myself back together,

1078
01:21:46.736 --> 01:21:50.537
and then you going off
doing the "poor old me" thing.

1079
01:21:50.539 --> 01:21:54.208
Oh, that's right, blame me!
It's my fault, isn't it?

1080
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:56.243
What are you fucking saying?
It's all my fault?

1081
01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:58.679
<i> You wouldn't have gotten</i>
<i> pregnant by that fucking...</i>

1082
01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:01.248
It's yours, Max.

1083
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.983
Trust me. I didn't
take any risks.

1084
01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:04.485
It can only be yours.

1085
01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.557
I told you to be gone, man.

1086
01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:13.193
Time moves on,
and you ain't nothing
but a dumb relic now.

1087
01:22:13.195 --> 01:22:16.630
Vincent told me
if I don't get rid of you,
then we're both done.

1088
01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:18.365
Go on, fucking do it, then!

1089
01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:20.567
Go on! Do it!

1090
01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:24.471
You have to end this now.
You have to make a decision.

1091
01:22:24.473 --> 01:22:25.806
What do you really,
really want?

1092
01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:27.374
What's important to you?

1093
01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.583
You're not even
gonna do it, are you?

1094
01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:38.185
He's a fucking pussy, yo!

1095
01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:39.620
Hey, step
aside, kings.

1096
01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:46.160
Oh, shit.

1097
01:22:46.162 --> 01:22:48.362
Think about your children.
Think about Leo and Evie.

1098
01:22:48.364 --> 01:22:50.597
<i> They need you.</i>
<i> They need their dad.</i>

1099
01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.234
Max, talk to me.

1100
01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:00.374
<i> Put down the gun!</i>

1101
01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:33.374
All right.
All right.

1102
01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:35.876
Yeah.
All right.

1103
01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:38.312
<i> I give up. All right.</i>

1104
01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:39.913
<i> Put down the gun!</i>

1105
01:23:39.915 --> 01:23:42.416
I'm putting it down,
all right?

1106
01:23:42.418 --> 01:23:45.386
I'm putting it down.
I'm putting it down. Look.

1107
01:23:45.388 --> 01:23:48.288
All right, there it is.
<i> Put your hands up!</i>

1108
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:50.691
I'm a fucking idiot.

1109
01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:55.429
<i> Put your hands</i>
<i> on your head!</i>

1110
01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:09.209
<i> Suspect has given himself up.</i>

1111
01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:25.926
Kathy?

1112
01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:28.028
Kathy, love?

1113
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.230
Hello, Leon.
Where's mom?

1114
01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.101
Kathy?

1115
01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:39.239
Kath!

1116
01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:56.123
Here you go, mate.
Here's your drink.
Cheers, man.

1117
01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.094
Surprise!

1118
01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:03.197
Happy anniversary, babe!

1119
01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:05.299
Come here, silly bollocks.

1120
01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:19.366
If we get a kid,
he's gonna play rugby.

1121
01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:21.868
A game for gentleman,
not hooligans.

1122
01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:41.722
Oh, I've got
something for you.
Yeah?

1123
01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:48.262
What's this?
A future, mom says.

1124
